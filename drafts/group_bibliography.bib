These ideas have evolved and intersected with other developments, therefore, the concept is developed it both from the point of view of an equivalent operator potential and from scattering theory. It is suggested that a correct pseudopotential is defined as one that gave the same energy levels as the real potential, a t least for a range of states of interest, with the emphasis on transforming the Schroedinger equation from. In the chapter, the augmented plane wave, orthogonalized plane wave, Ziman, and Abarenkov forms are discussed. It is reported that with the perspective of time, it also seems appropriate to review why the whole concept of a pseudopotential is necessary, and the cancellation theorem is treated more satisfactorily than previously.},

abstract = {The effects of hydration are included in empirical conformational energy computations on oligopeptides by means of a modified hydration‐shell model. Free energy terms are introduced to account for “specific hydration” due to water–solute hydrogen bonding and for “nonspecific hydration” describing the interaction of the solute with water molecules in a first‐neighbor shell. The dielectric constant has been doubled (over the value used for calculations in the absence of water) to take into account the presence of solvent. Computations were carried out for the N‐acetyl‐N′‐methylamides of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. Conformational energy maps are compared with similar maps calculated in the absence of hydration. Minimum‐energy conformations are located and compared with the corresponding minima for unhydrated peptides in terms of ordering with respect to potential energy, the dihedral angles at the minima, and the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The Boltzmann factors for various conformational regions are altered significantly on hydration in some cases. These changes can be explained in terms of differences in the hydration free energy terms for various conformations. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1979 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

@article{Reichardt1979,
abstract = {Although the effect of solvent on the rate and the position of equilibrium of chemical reactions has been known since the last century, there are still no reliable and exact methods for a quantitative description and prediction of such solvent effects. Empirical parameters of solvent polarity are of great value in this respect and can be derived with the aid of the principle of “linear relationships between free energies” (LFE relationships). The present article deals with the possibilities of establishing reaction and absorption series using solvent‐dependent standard reactions or standard absorptions of organic compounds. Particular attention is merited by the summary of the 24 most important empirical parameters of solvent polarity and the table of ET(30) values for 151 solvents. In addition to examples of the application of these values, attempts to improve the LFE correlations of singular empirical parameters of solvent polarity with the aid of multiparametric equations are described.

abstract = {Within the framework of the many-body Green's-function method we present a new approach to the polarization propagator for finite Fermi systems. This approach makes explicit use of the diagrammatic perturbation expansion for the polarization propagator, and reformulates the exact summation in terms of a simple algebraic scheme, referred to as the algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC). The ADC defines in a natural way a set of approximation schemes (nth-order ADC schemes) which represent infinite partial summations exact up to nth order of perturbation theory. In contrast to the randomphase- approximation (RPA)-like schemes, the corresponding mathematical procedures are essentially Hermitian eigenvalue problems in limited configuration spaces of unperturbed excited configurations. Explicit equations for the first- and second-order ADC schemes are derived. These schemes are thoroughly discussed and compared with the Tamm- Dancoff approximation and RPA schemes.},

The methods are applied to a set of 48 tripeptide fragments forming $\beta$-loops. It is shown that the type II turns form a class on their own, but that types I and III turns have very similar geometry and that their populations are not distinct.

abstract = {An improved method for computing potential-derived charges is described which is based upon the CHELP program available from QCPE.1 This approach (CHELPG) is shown to be considerably less dependent upon molecular orientation than the original CHELP program. In the second part of this work, the CHELPG point selection algorithm was used to analyze the changes in the potential-derived charges in formamide during rotation about the C---N bond. In order to achieve a level of rotational invariance less than 10{\%} of the magnitude of the electronic effects studied, an equally-spaced array of points 0.3 {\AA} apart was required. Points found to be greater than 2.8 {\AA} from any nucleus were eliminated, along with all points contained within the defined VDW distances from each of the atoms. The results are compared to those obtained by using CHELP. Even when large numbers of points (ca. 3000) were sampled using the CHELP selection routine, the results did not indicate a satisfactory level of rotatational invariance. On the basis of these results, the original CHELP program was found to be inadequate for analyzing internal rotations.},

Inverse solvatochromism was observed in solvents of very low polarity for polar dyes, and in polar solvents for dyes containing hydrophobic substituents. This inversion of the solvatochromic behaviour is attributed to aggregation phenomena. Keywords: merocyanines, solvatochromism, betaine, aggregation.},

abstract = {The displacement of electronic absorption and luminescence spectra (solvatochromic shifts) are related to the solute-medium interactions. These interactions can be non-specific (dielectric interactions) when they depend only on multiple and polarizability properties of the solute and solvent molecules; but specific associations such as hydrogen bonding can also be important. A number of examples of solvatochromic shifts are shown and discussed according to the various solute-medium interactions. The properties of solvent mixtures and those of rigid media are considered, as well as the ``thermochromic shifts'' which result from the change in the temperature of the medium. The use of solvatochromic shifts for the determination of the dipole moment and of the polarizability of electronically excited molecules has been important for an understanding of electron distribution changes in such states; examples of such determinations are given, together with references to the original literature. In the final section some limitations of the theories of solvent shifts and possible improvements are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {We propose fuzzy clustering as a method to analyze molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, especially of proteins and polypeptides. A fuzzy cluster analysis locates classes of similar three‐dimensional conformations explored during a molecular dynamics simulation. The method can be readily applied to results from both equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulations, with clustering on either global or local structural parameters. The potential of this technique is illustrated by results from fuzzy cluster analyses of trajectories from MD simulations of various fragments of human parathyroid hormone (PTH). For large molecules, it is more efficient to analyze the clustering of root‐mean‐square distances between conformations comprising the trajectory. We found that the results of the clustering analysis were unambiguous, in terms of the optimal number of clusters of conformations, for the majority of the trajectories examined. The conformation closest to the cluster center can be chosen as being representative of the class of structures making up the cluster, and can be further analyzed, for example, in terms of its secondary structure. The CPU time used by the cluster analysis was negligible compared to the MD simulation time. {\textcopyright} 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {The microscopic interactions and mechanisms leading to nascent protein folding events are generally unknown. While such short time-scale events are difficult to study experimentally, molecular dynamics simulations of peptides can provide a useful model for studying events related to protein folding initiation. Recently, two extremely long molecular dynamics simulations (2.2 ns each) were carried out on the pentapeptide Tyr-Pro-Gly-Asp-Val [Tobias, D. J., Mertz, J. E., & Brooks, C. L., III (1991) Biochemistry 30, 6054–6058] that forms stable reverse turns in solution. Tobias et al. examined folding events in this large system (∼ 30 000 conformations) using traditional methods of trajectory analysis. The shear magnitude of this problem prompted us to develop an automated approach, based on self-organizing neural nets, to extract the key features of the molecular dynamics trajectory. The neural net is used to perform conformational clustering, which reduces the complexity of a system while minimizing the loss of information. The conformations were grouped together using distances in dihedral angle space as a measure of conformational similarity. The resulting clusters represent “conformational states”, and transitions between these states were examined to identify mechanisms of conformational change. Many conformational changes involved the rotation of only a single dihedral angle, but concerted angle changes were also found. Most of the conformational information in the 30 000 samples from the full trajectories was retained in the relatively few resultant clusters, providing a powerful tool for analysis of an expanding base of large molecular simulations. {\textcopyright} 1993, American Chemical Society.

abstract = {This paper describes a computational strategy for the superposition of a set of flexible molecules. The combinatorial problems of searching conformational space and molecular matching are reduced drastically by the combined use of simulated annealing methods and cluster analysis. For each molecule, the global minimum of the conformational energy is determined by annealing and the search trajectory is retained in a history file. All the significantly different low-energy conformations are extracted by cluster analysis of data in the history file. Each pair of molecules, in each of their significantly different conformations, is then matched by simulated annealing, using the difference-distance matrix as the objective function. A set of match statistics is then obtained, from which the best match taken from all different conformations can be found. The molecules are then superposed either by reference to a base molecule or by a consensus method. This strategy ensures that as wide a range of conformations as possible is considered, but at the same time that the smallest number of significantly different conformations is used. The method has been tested on a set of six angiotensin II antagonists with between 7-11 rotatable bonds. {\textcopyright} 1993 ESCOM Science Publishers B.V.},

abstract = {A theoretical approach to the description of the electronic structure of molecules adsorbed on solid surfaces and surface reactions is described. The objective is a quantitative, molecular level, understanding of surface processes, including chemisorption energetics, adsorbate structure and reaction mechanisms. The electronic structure problem is formulated as an embedded cluster of atoms in which a localization transformation is used to define the electronic subspace that interacts strongly with the adsorbate and surface region. This permits ab initio SCF and CI calculations of molecular quality to be performed on a portion of the lattice-adsorbate system. Assumptions of the theory are discussed and applications to chemisorption on transition metal substrates are referenced.},

Of the two algorithms used, the single linkage method is inappropriate for this kind of data.

abstract = {Using energy minimization and cluster analysis, we have analyzed a 1020 ps molecular dynamics trajectory of solvated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. Elucidation of conformational sub states in this way both illustrates the degree of conformational convergence in the simulation and reduces the structural data to a tractable subset. The relative movement of structures upon energy minimization was used to estimate the sizes of features on the protein potential energy surface. The structures were analyzed using their pairwise root‐mean‐square C$\alpha$ deviations, which gave a global measure of conformational changes that would not be apparent by monitoring single degrees of freedom. At time scales of 0.1 ps, energy minimization detected sharp transitions between energy minima separated by 0.1 {\AA} rms deviation. Larger conformational clusters containing these smaller minima and separated by 0.25 {\AA} were seen at 1 ps time scales. Both of these small features of the conformational landscape were characterized by movements in loop regions associated with small, correlated backbone dihedral angle shifts. On a nanosecond time scale, the main features of the protein energy landscape were clusters separated by over 0.7 {\AA} rms deviation, with only seven of these sub states visited over the 1 ns trajectory. These substates, discernible both before and after energy minimization, differ mainly in a monotonic pivot of the loop residues 11–18 over the course of the simulation. This loop contains lysine 17, which specifically binds to trypsin in the active site. The trajectory did not return to previously visited clusters, indicating that this trajectory has not been shown to have completely sampled the conformational substates available to it. Because the apparent convergence to a single region of conformation space depends on both the time scale of observation and the size of the conformational features examined, convergence must be operationally defined within the context of the simulation. {\textcopyright} 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

The solute, which one can most generally envision as including some number of solvent molecules as well, is treated in a fully ab initio manner, using an appropriate level of electronic structure theory. Ln addition to the fragment model itself, formulae are presented that permit the determination of analytic energy gradients and, therefore, numerically determined energy second derivatives (hessians) for the complete system.

abstract = {We review the dynamical mean-field theory of strongly correlated electron systems which is based on a mapping of lattice models onto quantum impurity models subject to a self-consistency condition. This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview,of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed. Computer programs for the numerical implementation of this method are also provided with this article.},

abstract = {{Ground‐state properties of a linear hydrogen‐bonded FH$\ldots$NCH complex are studied by means of the ‘‘freeze‐and‐thaw'' cycle of Kohn–Sham Equations with constrained electron density (KSCED) [T. A. Wesolowski and J. Weber, Chem. Phys. Lett. 248, 71, (1996)]. For several geometries of the complex, the electron density and the total energy are compared to the ones obtained by means of the standard Kohn–Sham calculations. The comparisons are made to assess the accuracy of several gradient dependent approximate kinetic energy functionals applied in the KSCED equations. It was found that the closest results to the Kohn–Sham ones were obtained with the functional whose analytical form was proposed by Perdew and Wang for exchange energy [J. P. Perdew and Y. Wang in Electronic Structure of Solids '91, edited by P. Ziesche and H. Eschrig (Academie Verlag, Berlin, 1991), p. 11] and parametrized by Lembarki and Chermette for kinetic energy [A. Lembarki and H. Chermette, Phys. Rev. A 50, 5328 (1994)]. Around the interactionenergy minimum as well as for larger intermolecular distances, the ‘‘freeze‐and‐thaw'' cycle of KSCED leads to very similar potential energy surface as the standard supermolecule Kohn–Sham calculations.}},

abstract = {Full geometry optimizations on oligoenes have been performed with Hartree-Fock and density functional theory in combination with double zeta and triple zeta quality basis sets with primary focus on the degree of bond length alternation and on the energy gap. Monitoring the dependence of the computed properties on the oligomer size provides new insights into the reliability of the calculations, which are analyzed in terms of dynamical and nondynamical electron correlation. Our theoretical bond length alternation values for the oligomers of polyacetylene extrapolate to significantly smaller values than what has been established by experiments and earlier theoretical predictions. The exact exchange mixing to the exchange-correlation functional not only improves the agreement of the theoretical gap of oligoenes with experimental excitation energies but also increases the computed bond length alternations. Based on a newly proposed one parameter functional of Becke, the effect of the exact exchange mixing has been further identified, and a practical measure of nondynamical correlation energy has been suggested. The popular Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr density functional produces bond alternation values that are unacceptably small. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {New protein parameters are reported for the all-atom empirical energy function in the CHARMM program. The parameter evaluation was based on a self-consistent approach designed to achieve a balance between the internal (bonding) and interaction (nonbonding) terms of the force field and among the solvent - solvent, solvent - solute, and solute - solute interactions. Optimization of the internal parameters used experimental gas-phase geometries, vibrational spectra, and torsional energy surfaces supplemented with ab initio results. The peptide backbone bonding parameters were optimized with respect to data for N-methylacetamide and the alanine dipeptide. The interaction parameters, particularly the atomic charges, were determined by fitting ab initio interaction energies and geometries of complexes between water and model compounds that represented the backbone and the various side chains. In addition, dipole moments, experimental heats and free energies of vaporization, solvation and sublimation, molecular volumes, and crystal pressures and structures were used in the optimization. The resulting protein parameters were tested by applying them to noncyclic tripeptide crystals, cyclic peptide crystals, and the proteins crambin, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and carbonmonoxy myoglobin in vacuo and in crystals. A detailed analysis of the relationship between the alanine dipeptide potential energy surface and calculated protein $\phi$, $\chi$ angles was made and used in optimizing the peptide group torsional parameters. The results demonstrate that use of ab initio structural and energetic data by themselves are not sufficient to obtain an adequate backbone representation for peptides and proteins in solution and in crystals. Extensive comparisons between molecular dynamics simulations and experimental data for polypeptides and proteins were performed for both structural and dynamic properties. Energy minimization and dynamics simulations for crystals demonstrate that the latter are needed to obtain meaningful comparisons with experimental crystal structures. The presented parameters, in combination with the previously published CHARMM all-atom parameters for nucleic acids and lipids, provide a consistent set for condensed-phase simulations of a wide variety of molecules of biological interest.},

At each of these temperatures, the 50-ns simulations were sufficient to generate an equilibrium distribution between a relatively small number of conformations ($\sim$102), showing that, even above the melting temperature ($\sim$340 K), the peptide does not randomly sample conformational space. The free energy of folding and the free energy difference between pairs of conformations have been calculated from their relative populations. The experimentally determined folded conformation at 298 K, a left-handed 31-helix, is at each of the four temperatures the predominant conformation, with its probability and average lifetime decreasing with increasing temperature. The most common intermediates of folding and unfolding are also the same at the four temperatures. Paths and rates of interconversion between different conformations have been determined. It has been found that folding can occur through multiple pathways, not necessarily downhill in free energy, although the final step involves a reduced number of intermediates.},

Because of the reduced number of necessary quantum calculations, it is possible to get the same level of theory used for molecules in vacuo. The electronic structure of the solute in solution and the solvent structure around it are optimized in a self-consistent way. The main characteristics of the proposed method are high-level quantum calculations in the representation of the solute, a detailed description of the solvent structure through molecular dynamics calculation, inclusion of the mutual polarization of the solute and solvent molecules, and an accurate description of the solute-solvent interaction energy. As an application of the model we studied the polarization of quantum mechanically treated water and methanol molecules in the liquid phase. {\textcopyright} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Results of free energy calculations, in agreement with previous experimental data, indicate that a conformation with a turn from residues 5 through 8 is preferred for GnRH in an aqueous environment. By contrast, a conformation with a helix from residues 2 through 7 with a bend from residues 6 through 10 is preferred for lGnRH-III in an aqueous environment. The side chains of His2 and Trp3 in lGnRH-III occupy different regions of phase space and participate in weakly polar interactions different from those in GnRH. The unique conformational properties of lGnRH-III may account for its specific anti cancer activity.},

abstract = {A wavefunction has been derived for the oxalic acid dihydrate molecule using accurate low-temperature X-ray electron-density structure-factor data. The electron density from this constrained theoretical wavefunction is compared to those of unconstrained theoretical wavefunctions. Fitted electron densities around hydrogen atoms show significant deviation compared to Hartree-Fock calculations. In particular, hydrogen bonding appears enhanced in the crystal over theoretical predictions, while the density usually attributed to lone-pair electrons of the oxalic acid oxygen atoms is decreased. The constrained fitting procedure improves the overall agreement of the calculated structure factors even for structure factors that were not used as input to the fitting procedure. The pictures obtained from the constrained fitting procedure are insensitive to random errors introduced into the data. Similarly, the fitting procedure is able to reproduce features that arise from more accurate theoretical calculations. However, we are unable to fit our wavefunction to within the experimentally quoted error bounds without allowing an unreasonably large change in the energy of the constrained wavefunction. Large Hartree-Fock and density functional theory (DFT) cluster calculations involving up to 86 atoms in size also do not show significantly improved agreement with the experimentally observed structure factors. Derived properties from the constrained wavefunction fragments, such as the kinetic energy, electrostatic potential and the electron localization function, are also presented. In general, there are no difficulties in extracting experimental wavefunctions and the associated derived properties from elastic X-ray scattering data for crystal fragments of the order of 20 atoms.},

abstract = {An experimental wavefunction is one that has an assumed form and that is also fitted to experimental measurements according to some well defined procedure. In this paper, the concept of extracting wavefunctions from experimental data is critically examined and past efforts are reviewed. In particular, the importance of scattering experiments for wavefunction fitting schemes is highlighted in relation to the more familiar model, the Hamiltonian paradigm. A general and systematically improvable method for fitting a wavefunction to experimental data is proposed. In this method, the parameters in a model wavefunction are determined according to the variational theorem but subject to an imposed constraint that an agreement statistic between the calculated and observed experimental data has a certain acceptable value. Advantages of the method include the fact that any amount of experimental data can be used in the fitting procedure irrespective of the number of parameters in the model wavefunction, the fact that a unique answer is obtained for a given choice of the model wavefunction, and the fact that the method can be used to model different experiments simultaneously. The wavefunction fitting method is illustrated by developing the theory for extracting a single-determinant wavefunction for a fragment of a molecular crystal, using data obtained from elastic X-ray scattering data. Effects due to thermal motion of the nuclei, secondary extinction of the X-ray scattering and different choices for the crystal fragment are treated.},

In case of alignments, their quality is taken into account using a weighted c-means scheme, developed in this work. The performance of fuzzy cluster validity measures, such as compactness, partition function, and entropy, are studied on several examples, but the visual 3D representation of data points is shown to be most beneficial in determining the optimum number of clusters. Fuzzy clustering is expected to perform better than crisp clustering methods in cases where there are a significant number of ``outliers'', such as in molecular dynamics simulations and molecular alignments.},

abstract = {The constrained Hartree-Fock method using experimental X-ray diffraction data is extended and applied to the case of noncentrosymmetric molecular crystals. A new way to estimate the errors in derived properties as a derivative with respect to added Gaussian noise is also described. Three molecular crystals are examined: ammonia [NH3], urea [CO(NH2)2], and alloxan [(CO)4(NH)2]. The energetic and electrical properties of these molecules in the crystalline state are presented. In all cases, an enhancement of the dipole moment is observed upon application of the experimental constraint. It is found that the phases of the structure factors are robustly determined by the constrained Hartree-Fock model, even in the presence of simulated noise. Plots of the electron density, electrostatic potential, and the electron localization function for the molecules in the crystal are displayed. In general, relative to the Hartree-Fock model, there is a depletion of charge around hydrogen atoms and lone pair regions, and a build-up of charge within the molecular framework near nuclei, directed along the bonds. The electron localization function plots reveal an increase in the pair density between vicinal hydrogen atoms.},

abstract = {On the basis of the Franck-Condon principle, a density functional vertical self-consistent reaction field (VSCRF) solvation model for vertical excitation and emission processes is established. The principles and implementation of the VSCRF model are presented. The predicted blue shifts of the vertical excitation energies of diazines in different solvents from n-heptane to water solutions are compared with the corresponding time dependent density functional calculations and are in very good agreement with experiment. We have also applied this method to predict the blue shifts and the vertical excitation and emission energies of Brooker's merocyanine dye with increasing solvent polarities from CHCl 3 to H 2O solutions. Overall, our calculations predicted the relative excitation and emission energy orderings for Brooker's merocyanine in different solvents with different polarities. Also, the calculated Stokes shift is fairly well represented for different solvents, and the calculations correctly show that the absorption energies have a much stronger solvent dependence than the emission energies.

abstract = {Computational studies of proteins based on empirical force fields represent a powerful tool to obtain structure-function relationships at an atomic level, and are central in current efforts to solve the protein folding problem. The results from studies applying these tools are, however, dependent on the quality of the force fields used. In particular, accurate treatment of the peptide backbone is crucial to achieve representative conformational distributions in simulation studies. To improve the treatment of the peptide backbone, quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular mechanical (MM) calculations were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and proline dipeptides, and the results from these calculations were combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins in crystal and aqueous environments. QM potential energy maps of the alanine and glycine dipeptides at the LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G* levels, where x = D, T, and Q, were determined, and are compared to available QM studies on these molecules. The LMP2/cc-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G* energy surfaces for all three dipeptides were then used to improve the MM treatment of the dipeptides. These improvements included additional parameter optimization via Monte Carlo simulated annealing and extension of the potential energy function to contain peptide backbone $\phi$, $\psi$ dihedral crossterms or a $\phi$, $\psi$ grid-based energy correction term. Simultaneously, MD simulations of up to seven proteins in their crystalline environments were used to validate the force field enhancements. Comparison with QM and crystallographic data showed that an additional optimization of the $\phi$, $\psi$ dihedral parameters along with the grid-based energy correction were required to yield significant improvements over the CHARMM22 force field. However, systematic deviations in the treatment of $\phi$ and $\psi$ in the helical and sheet regions were evident. Accordingly, empirical adjustments were made to the grid-based energy correction for alanine and glycine to account for these systematic differences. These adjustments lead to greater deviations from QM data for the two dipeptides but also yielded improved agreement with experimental crystallographic data. These improvements enhance the quality of the CHARMM force field in treating proteins. This extension of the potential energy function is anticipated to facilitate improved treatment of biological macromolecules via MM approaches in general. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Propagator methods provide a direct approach to energies and transition moments for (generalized) electronic excitations from the ground state, but they do not usually allow one to determine excited state wave functions and properties. Using a specific intermediate state representation (ISR) concept, we here show how this restriction can be overcome in the case of the algebraic-diagrammatic construction (ADC) propagator approach. In the ISR reformulation of the theory the basic ADC secular matrix is written as a representation of the Hamiltonian (or the shifted Hamiltonian) in terms of explicitly constructable states, referred to as intermediate (or ADC) states. Similar intermediate state representations can be derived for operators other than the Hamiltonian. Together with the ADC eigenvectors, the intermediate states give rise to an explicit formulation of the excited wave functions and allow one to calculate physical properties of excited states as well as transition moments for transitions between different excited states. As for the ground-state excitation energies and transition moments, the ADC excited state properties are size consistent so that the theory is suitable for applications to large systems. The established hierarchy of higher-order [ADC(n)] approximations, corresponding to systematic truncations of the IS configuration space and the perturbation-theoretical expansions of the ISR matrix elements, can readily be extended to the excited state properties. Explicit ISR matrix elements for arbitrary one-particle operators have been derived and coded at the second-order [ADC(2)] level of theory. As a first computational test of the method we have carried out ADC(2) calculations for singlet and triplet excited state dipole moments in H(2)O and HF, where comparison to full CI results can be made. The potential of the ADC(2) method is further demonstrated in an exploratory study of the excitation energies and dipole moments of the low-lying excited states of paranitroaniline. We find that four triplet states, T1-T4, and two singlet states, S1 and S2, lie (vertically) below the prominent charge transfer (CT) excitation, S3. The dipole moment of the S3 state (17.0D) is distinctly larger than that of the corresponding T3 triplet state (11.7D).},

Unlike earlier schemes using central moments of the charge operator, the procedure presented here leads to a proper definition of multicenter bond indices for an arbitrary number of atoms. Formal relationships and numerical techniques for the typical configuration interaction (CI) approaches, up to full CI, are given and illustrated with simple molecular systems. Comparison of the molecular orbital and full CI results indicates strong electron correlation effects, especially for the 3-center and 4-center bond indices. Excited state multicenter bond indices are described within the CI singles approach. The problem of proper definition of atomic valence and bond indices for electronic states with nonzero spin is raised. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The mechanism of color tuning in the rhodopsin family of proteins has been studied by comparing the optical properties of the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin (bR) and the light detector sensory rhodopsin II (sRII). Despite a high structural similarity, the maximal absorption is blue-shifted from 568 nm in bR to 497 nm in sRII. The molecular mechanism of this shift is still a matter of debate, and its clarification sheds light onto the general mechanisms of color tuning in retinal proteins. The calculations employ a combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) technique, using a DFT-based method for ground state properties and the semiempirical OM2/MRCI method and ab initio SORCI method for excited state calculations. The high efficiency of the methodology has allowed us to study a wide variety of aspects including dynamical effects. The absorption shift as well as various mutation experiments and vibrational properties have been successfully reproduced. Our results indicate that several sources contribute to the spectral shift between bR and sRII. The main factors are the counterion region at the extracellular side of retinal and the amino acid composition of the binding pocket. Our analysis allows a distinction and identification of the different effects in detail and leads to a clear picture of the mechanism of color tuning, which is in good agreement with available experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We present new developments on a density-based embedding strategy for the electronic structure of localized feature in periodic, metallic systems [see T. Kluner et al., J. Chem. Phys. 116, 42 (2002), and references therein]. The total system is decomposed into an embedded cluster and a background, where the background density is regarded as fixed. Its effect on the embedded cluster is modeled as a one-electron potential derived from density functional theory. We first discuss details on the evaluation of the various contributions to the embedding potential and provide a strategy to incorporate the use of ultrasoft pseudopotentials in a consistent fashion. The embedding potential is obtained self-consistently with respect to both the total and embedded cluster densities in the embedding region, within the framework of a frozen background density. A strategy for accomplishing this self-consistency in a numerically stable manner is presented. Finally, we demonstrate how dynamical correlation effects can be treated within this embedding framework via the multireference singles and doubles configuration interaction method. Two applications of the embedding theory are presented. The first example considers a Cu dimer embedded in the (111) surface of Cu, where we explore the effects of different models for the kinetic energy potential. We find that the embedded Cu density is reasonably well-described using simple models for the kinetic energy. The second, more challenging example involves the adsorption of Co on the (111) surface of Cu, which has been probed experimentally with scanning tunneling microscopy [H. C. Manoharan et al., Nature (London) 403, 512 (2000)]. In contrast to Kohn-Sham density functional theory, our embedding approach predicts the correct spin-compensated ground state.},

abstract = {Quantifying the density of conformations over phase space (the conformational distribution) is needed to model important macromolecular processes such as protein folding. In this work, we quantify the conformational distribution for a simple polypeptide (N-mer polyalanine) using the cumulative distribution function (CDF), which gives the probability that two randomly selected conformations are separated by less than a ``conformational'' distance and whose inverse gives conformation counts as a function of conformational radius. An important finding is that the conformation counts obtained by the CDF inverse depend critically on the assignment of a conformation's distance span and the ensemble (e.g., unfolded state model): varying ensemble and conformation definition (1 → 2 {\AA}) varies the CDF-based conformation counts for Alaso from 1011 to 10 69. In particular, relatively short molecular dynamics (MD) relaxation of Alaso's random-walk ensemble reduces the number of conformers from 1055 to 1014 (using a 1 {\AA} root-mean-square-deviation radius conformation definition) pointing to potential disconnections in comparing the results from simplified models of unfolded proteins with those from all-atom MD simulations. Explicit waters are found to roughen the landscape considerably. Under some common conformation definitions, the results herein provide (i) an upper limit to the number of accessible conformations that compose unfolded states of proteins, (ii) the optimal clustering radius/conformation radius for counting conformations for a given energy and solvent model, (iii) a means of comparing various studies, and (iv) an assessment of the applicability of random search in protein folding. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

By validation on similar linear conjugated polymers, polyacetylene and polydiacetylene, the combination of hybrid-DFT schemes, B3LYP//BHandHLYP or B3LYP//KMLYP, is shown to give the best predictions for both geometry and band gap of polyyne based on available experimental data.

This method is conceptually similar to existing EDA methods such as Morokuma analysis but includes several important new features. The first is a fully self-consistent treatment of the energy lowering due to polarization, which is evaluated by a self-consistent field calculation in which the molecular orbital coefficients are constrained to be block-diagonal (absolutely localized) in the interacting molecules to prohibit charge transfer. The second new feature is the ability to separate forward and back-donation in the charge-transfer energy term using a perturbative approximation starting from the optimized block-diagonal reference.

@article{Shao2007,
abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation methods produce trajectories of atomic positions (and optionally velocities and energies) as a function of time and provide a representation of the sampling of a given molecule's energetically accessible conformational ensemble. As simulations on the 10-100 ns time scale become routine, with sampled configurations stored on the picosecond time scale, such trajectories contain large amounts of data. Data-mining techniques, like clustering, provide one means to group and make sense of the information in the trajectory. In this work, several clustering algorithms were implemented, compared, and utilized to understand MD trajectory data. The development of the algorithms into a freely available C code library, and their application to a simple test example of random (or systematically placed) points in a 2D plane (where the pairwise metric is the distance between points) provide a means to understand the relative performance. Eleven different clustering algorithms were developed, ranging from top-down splitting (hierarchical) and bottom-up aggregating (including single-linkage edge joining, centroid-linkage, average-linkage, complete-linkage, centripetal, and centripetal-complete) to various refinement (means, Bayesian, and self-organizing maps) and tree (COBWEB) algorithms. Systematic testing in the context of MD simulation of various DNA systems (including DNA single strands and the interaction of a minor groove binding drug DB226 with a DNA hairpin) allows a more direct assessment of the relative merits of the distinct clustering algorithms. Additionally, means to assess the relative performance and differences between the algorithms, to dynamically select the initial cluster count, and to achieve faster data mining by ``sieved clustering'' were evaluated. Overall, it was found that there is no one perfect ``one size fits all'' algorithm for clustering MD trajectories and that the results strongly depend on the choice of atoms for the pairwise comparison. Some algorithms tend to produce homogeneously sized clusters, whereas others have a tendency to produce singleton clusters. Issues related to the choice of a pairwise metric, clustering metrics, which atom selection is used for the comparison, and about the relative performance are discussed. Overall, the best performance was observed with the average-linkage, means, and SOM algorithms. If the cluster count is not known in advance, the hierarchical or average-linkage clustering algorithms are recommended. Although these algorithms perform well, it is important to be aware of the limitations or weaknesses of each algorithm, specifically the high sensitivity to outliers with hierarchical, the tendency to generate homogenously sized clusters with means, and the tendency to produce small or singleton clusters with average-linkage. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We present a simple and efficient embedding scheme for the wave-function based calculation of the energies of local excitations in large systems. By introducing an embedding potential obtained from density-functional theory (DFT) it is possible to describe the effect of an environment on local excitations of an embedded system in wave-function theory (WFT) calculations of the excitation energies. We outline the implementation of such a WFT-in-DFT embedding procedure employing the ADF, Dalton and DIRAC codes, where the embedded subsystem is treated with coupled cluster methods. We then evaluate this procedure in the calculation of the solvatochromic shift of acetone in water and of the f-f spectrum of NpO22+ embedded in a Cs2UO2Cl4 crystal and find that our scheme does effectively incorporate the environment effect in both cases. A particularly interesting finding is that with our embedding scheme we can model the equatorial Cl- ligands in NpO2Cl42- quite accurately, compared to a fully wavefunction-based calculation, and this opens up the possibility of modeling the interaction of different ligands to actinyl species with relatively high accuracy but at a much reduced computational cost.},

abstract = {A strategy to construct approximants to the kinetic-energy-functional dependent component (v(t)[rho(A),rho(B)](r)) of the effective potential in one-electron equations for orbitals embedded in a frozen-density environment [Eqs. (20) and (21) in Wesolowski and Warshel, J. Phys. Chem. 97, (1993) 8050] is proposed. In order to improve the local behavior of the orbital-free effective embedding potential near nuclei in the environment, the exact behavior of v(t)[rho(A),rho(B)](r) at rho(A)--{\textgreater}0 and integralrho(B)dr=2 is taken into account. As a result, the properties depending on the quality of this potential are invariably improved compared to the ones obtained using conventional approximants which violated the considered exact condition. The approximants obtained following the proposed strategy and especially the simplest one constructed in this work are nondecomposable, i.e., cannot be used to obtain the analytic expression for the functional of the total kinetic energy.},

This novel chiral cup-shaped molecule was isolated in racemic form and in excellent yield after the addition of methyl lithium to the BF 4 salt of a novel unsymmetrical diazaoxatriangulenium cation. Compound 6a was found to be stable under classical laboratory conditions-something not obvious considering the extreme stability of the carbenium ion precursor, the electron-rich nature of the core, and the strain induced by the pyramidalization of the central carbon. The enantiomers were readily separated by chiral stationary phase chromatography, and the absolute configuration of (-)-( S)- 6a was determined by a comparison of the experimental and theoretical vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra. This isolation of (-)-( S)- 6a and (+)-( R)- 6a constitutes thus the first report of a nonracemic closed-capped chiral bowl molecule for which the chirality is due to the intrinsic dissymmetry of the central core of the structure only.},

abstract = {We describe an embedded density functional theory (DFT) protocol in which the nonadditive kinetic energy component of the embedding potential is treated exactly. At each iteration of the Kohn-Sham equations for constrained electron density, the Zhao-Morrison-Parr constrained search method for constructing Kohn-Sham orbitals is combined with the King-Handy expression for the exact kinetic potential. We use this formally exact embedding protocol to calculate ionization energies for a series of three- and four-electron atomic systems, and the results are compared to embedded DFT calculations that utilize the Thomas-Fermi (TF) and the Thomas-Fermi-von Weisacker approximations to the kinetic energy functional. These calculations illustrate the expected breakdown due to the TF approximation for the nonadditive kinetic potential, with errors of 30{\%}-80{\%} in the calculated ionization energies; by contrast, the exact protocol is found to be accurate and stable. To significantly improve the convergence of the new protocol, we introduce a density-based switching function to map between the exact nonadditive kinetic potential and the TF approximation in the region of the nuclear cusp, and we demonstrate that this approximation has little effect on the accuracy of the calculated ionization energies. Finally, we describe possible extensions of the exact protocol to perform accurate embedded DFT calculations in large systems with strongly overlapping subsystem densities.},

abstract = {Using the technique of Perdew and Levy [Phys. Rev. B 31, 6264 (1985)], it is shown that both the density function theory (DFT)-in-DFT and wave function theory (WFT)-in-DFT embedding approaches are formally correct in studying not only the ground state but also a subset of the excited states of the total system. Without further approximations, the DFT-in-DFT embedding approach results in a pair of coupled Euler-Lagrange equations. In contrast to DFT-in-DFT, the WFT-in-DFT approach is shown to ensure a systematic description of excited states if such states are mainly related to excitations within the embedded subsystem. Possible ways for the practical realization of the WFT-in-DFT approach for studying excited states are briefly discussed.},

@article{Luzanov2010,
abstract = {We report here the results for an ab initio approach to obtain the parameters needed for molecular simulations using a polarizable force field. These parameters consist of the atomic charges, polarizabilities, and radii. The former two are readily obtained using methods reported previously (van Duijnen and Swart, J Phys Chem A 1998, 102, 2399; Swart et al. J Comput Chem 2001, 22, 79), whereas here we report a new approach for obtaining atomic second-order radii (SOR), which is based on second-order atomic moments in scaled Voronoi cells. These parameters are obtained from quantum- chemistry calculations on the monomers, and used without further adaptation directly for intermolecular interactions. The approach works very well as shown here for four dimers, where high-level coupled cluster with singles and doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) and density functional theory (DFT) Swart-Sola `-Bickelhaupt functional including Grimme's dispersion correction (SSB-D) reference data are available for comparison. The energy surfaces for the three methods are very similar, which is also the case for the interaction between a water molecule with either a chloride anion or a sodium cation. These latter systems had previously been used to criticize Thole's damped point-dipole method, but here we show that with the correct use of the method, it is perfectly able to describe the intermolecular interactions. This is most obvious for the induced dipole moment as function of the chloride-oxygen distance, where the direct (discrete) reaction field results are virtually indistinguishable from those obtained at CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ.},

abstract = {The bi-functional for the non-electrostatic part of the exact embedding potential of frozen-density embedding theory (FDET) depends on whether the embedded part is described by means of a real interacting many-electron system or the reference system of non-interacting electrons (see [Wesolowski, Phys. Rev. A. 77, 11444 (2008)]). The difference $\delta$$\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)]/$\delta$$\rho$(A)(r{\textless}combining arrow{\textgreater}), where $\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)] is the functional bound from below by the correlation functional E(c)[$\rho$(A)] and from above by zero. Taking into account $\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)] in both the embedding potential and in energy is indispensable for assuring that all calculated quantities are self-consistent and that FDET leads to the exact energy and density in the limit of exact functionals. Since not much is known about good approximations for $\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)], we examine numerically the adequacy of neglecting $\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)] entirely. To this end, we analyze the significance of $\delta$$\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)]/$\delta$$\rho$(A)(r{\textless}combining arrow{\textgreater}) in the case where the magnitude of $\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)] is the largest, i.e., for Hartree-Fock wavefunction. In hydrogen bonded model systems, neglecting $\delta$$\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)]/$\delta$$\rho$(A)(r{\textless}combining arrow{\textgreater}) in the embedding potential marginally affects the total energy (less than 5{\%} change in the interaction energy) but results in qualitative changes in the calculated hydrogen-bonding induced shifts of the orbital energies. Based on this estimation, we conclude that neglecting $\delta$$\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)]/$\delta$$\rho$(A)(r{\textless}combining arrow{\textgreater}) may represent a good approximation for multi-reference variational methods using adequate choice for the active space. Doing the same for single-reference perturbative methods is not recommended. Not only it leads to violation of self-consistency but might result in large effect on orbital energies. It is shown also that the errors in total energy due to neglecting $\delta$$\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)]/$\delta$$\rho$(A)(r{\textless}combining arrow{\textgreater}) do not cancel but rather add up to the errors due to approximation for the bi-functional of the non-additive kinetic potential.},

abstract = {The ASEP-MD method has been employed for studying the solvent effect on the conformational equilibrium of the alanine dipeptide in water solution. MP2 and density functional theory (DFT) levels of theory were used and results were compared. While in gas phase cyclic structures showing intramolecular hydrogen bonds were found to be the most stable, the stability order is reversed in water solution. Intermolecular interaction with the solvent causes the predominance of extended structures as the stabilizing contacts dipeptide-water are favoured. Free-energy differences in solution were calculated and PPII, R, and C5 conformers were identified as the most stable at MP2 level. Experimental data from Raman and IR techniques show discrepancies about the relative abundance of R y C5, our results support the Raman data. The DFT level of theory agrees with MP2 in the location and stability of PPII and R forms but fails in the location of C5. MP2 results suggest the possibility of finding traces of C7eq conformer in water solution, in agreement with recent experiments. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Rezac2011,
abstract = {With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.},

@article{Herbert2012,
abstract = {A method that we have recently introduced for rapid computation of intermolecular interaction energies is reformulated and subjected to further tests. The method employs monomer-based self-consistent field calculations with an electrostatic embedding designed to capture many-body polarization (the ``XPol'' procedure), augmented by pairwise symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) to capture dispersion and exchange interactions along with any remaining induction effects. A rigorous derivation of the XPol+SAPT methodology is presented here, which demonstrates that the method is systematically improvable, and moreover introduces some additional intermolecular interactions as compared to the more heuristic derivation that was presented previously. Applications to various non-covalent complexes and clusters are presented, including geometry optimizations and one-dimensional potential energy scans. The performance of the XPol+SAPT methodology in its present form (based on second-order intermolecular perturbation theory and neglecting intramolecular electron correlation) is qualitatively acceptable across a wide variety of systems-and quantitatively quite good in certain cases-but the quality of the results is rather sensitive to the choice of one-particle basis set. Basis sets that work well for dispersion-bound systems offer less-than-optimal performance for clusters dominated by induction and electrostatic interactions, and vice versa. A compromise basis set is identified that affords good results for both induction and dispersion interactions, although this favorable performance ultimately relies on error cancellation, as in traditional low-order SAPT. Suggestions for future improvements to the methodology are discussed.},

abstract = {It has become common to reference ``pi-stacking'' forces or ``pi-pi interactions'' when describing the interactions between neighbouring aromatic rings. Here, we review experimental and theoretical literature across several fields and conclude that the terms ``pi-stacking'' and ``pi-pi interactions'' do not accurately describe the forces that drive association between aromatic molecules of the types most commonly studied in chemistry or biology laboratories. We therefore propose that these terms are misleading and should no longer be used. Even without these terms, electrostatic considerations relating to polarized pi systems, as described by Hunter and Sanders, have provided a good qualitative starting place for predicting and understanding the interactions between aromatics for almost two decades. More recent work, however, is revealing that direct electrostatic interactions between polarized atoms of substituents as well as solvation/desolvation effects in strongly interacting solvents must also be considered and even dominate in many circumstances.},

Not only are the position and spatial extent given, but insight into the intrinsic structure of the exciton is readily obtained as well. For example, the method can differentiate between excitonic and charge resonance interactions even in completely symmetric systems. Four examples are considered to highlight the utility of the approach: interactions between the n$\pi$* states in a formaldehyde dimer, excimer formation in the naphthalene dimer, stacking interaction in an adenine dimer, and the excitonic band structure in a conjugated phenylenevinylene oligomer.},

abstract = {Embedding potentials are frequently used to describe the effect of an environment on the electronic structure of molecules in larger systems, including their excited states. If such excitations are accompanied by significant rearrangements in the electron density of the embedded molecule, large differential polarization effects may take place, which in turn can require state-specific embedding potentials for an accurate theoretical description. We outline here how to extend wave function in density functional theory (WF/DFT) methods to compute the excitation energies of a molecule in a responsive environment through the use of state-specific density-based embedding potentials constructed within a modified subsystem DFT approach. We evaluate the general expression of the ground- and excited-state energy difference of the total system both with the use of state-independent and state-dependent embedding potentials, and propose some practical recipes to construct the approximate excited-state DFT density of the active part used to polarize the environment. We illustrate these concepts with the state-independent and state-dependent WF/DFT computation of the excitation energies of pnitroaniline, acrolein, methylenecyclopropene, and p-nitrophenolate in various solvents.$\backslash$nEmbedding potentials are frequently used to describe the effect of an environment on the electronic structure of molecules in larger systems, including their excited states.

The CASPT2 method is employed to calculate absorption and emission energies of uracil in gas and in aqueous solution. An average discrete electrostatic model is used to include the solvent effect. The results for the calculated absorption and emission transitions are found in good agreement with experiment both in gas phase and in water. The solvent effect on the Stokes shift is also calculated in good agreement with experiment. These agreements lend additional credence to the structures obtained for the lowest $\pi \to \pi^*$ excited state.}

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of our recently proposed wavefunction in density functional theory method to include differential polarization effects through state-specific embedding potentials. We study methylenecyclopropene and acrolein in water by using several wavefunction approaches to validate the supermolecular reference and to assess their response to embedding. We find that quantum Monte Carlo, complete-active space second-order perturbation theory, and coupled cluster methods give very consistent solvatochromic shifts and a similar response to embedding. Our scheme corrects the excitation energies produced with a frozen environment, but the values are often overshot. To ameliorate the problem, one needs to use wavefunction densities to polarize the environment. The choice of the exchange-correlation functional in the construction of the potential has little effect on the excitation, whereas the approximate kinetic-energy functional appears to be the largest source of error.},

abstract = {The recently developed X-ray constrained extremely localized molecular orbital (XC-ELMO) technique is a potentially useful tool for the determination and analysis of experimental electron densities. Molecular orbitals strictly localized on atoms, bonds or functional groups allow one to combine the quantum-mechanical rigour of the wavefunction-based approaches with the easy chemical interpretability typical of the traditional multipole models. In this paper, using very high quality X-ray diffraction data for the glycylglycine crystal, a detailed assessment of the capabilities and limitations of this new method is given. In particular, the effects of constraining the ELMO wavefunctions to experimental X-ray structure-factor amplitudes and the ability of the method to reproduce benchmark electron distributions have been accurately investigated. Topological analysis of the XC-ELMO electron densities and of the zero-flux surface-integrated charges and dipole moments shows that the new strategy is already reliable, provided that sufficiently flexible basis sets are used. These analyses also raise new questions and call for further improvements of the method.},

abstract = {Recent application of the Frozen-Density Embedding Theory based continuum model of the solvent, which is used for calculating solvatochromic shifts in the UV/Vis range, are reviewed. In this model, the solvent is represented as a non-uniform continuum taking into account both the statistical nature of the solvent and specific solute-solvent interactions. It offers, therefore, a computationally attractive alternative to methods in which the solvent is described at atomistic level. The evaluation of the solvatochromic shift involves only two calculations of excitation energy instead of at least hundreds needed to account for inhomogeneous broadening. The present review provides a detailed graphical analysis of the key quantities of this model: the average charge density of the solvent (〈$\rho$B〉) and the corresponding Frozen-Density Embedding Theory derived embedding potential for coumarin 153.},

abstract = {Frozen-Density-Embedding Theory (FDET) is a formalism to obtain the upper bound of the ground-state energy of the total system and the corresponding embedded wavefunction by means of Euler-Lagrange equations [T. A. Wesolowski, Phys. Rev. A 77(1), 012504 (2008)]. FDET provides the expression for the embedding potential as a functional of the electron density of the embedded species, electron density of the environment, and the field generated by other charges in the environment. Under certain conditions, FDET leads to the exact ground-state energy and density of the whole system. Following Perdew-Levy theorem on stationary states of the ground-state energy functional, the other-than-ground-state stationary states of the FDET energy functional correspond to excited states. In the present work, we analyze such use of other-than-ground-state embedded wavefunctions obtained in practical calculations, i.e., when the FDET embedding potential is approximated. Three computational approaches based on FDET, that assure self-consistent excitation energy and embedded wavefunction dealing with the issue of orthogonality of embedded wavefunctions for different states in a different manner, are proposed and discussed.},

abstract = {Frozen density embedding (FDE) has become a popular subsystem density functional theory (DFT) method for systems with weakly overlapping charge densities. The failure of this method for strongly interacting and covalent systems is due to the approximate kinetic energy density functional (KEDF), although the need for approximate KEDFs may be eliminated if each subsystem's Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals are orthogonal to the other, termed external orthogonality (EO). We present an implementation of EO into the FDE framework within the Amsterdam density functional program package, using the level-shift projection operator method. We generalize this method to remove the need for orbital localization schemes and to include multiple subsystems, and we show that the exact KS-DFT energies and densities may be reproduced through iterative freeze-and-thaw cycles for a number of systems, including a charge delocalized benzene molecule starting from atomic subsystems. Finally, we examine the possibility of a truncated basis for systems with and without charge delocalization, and found that subsystems require a basis that allows them to correctly describe the supermolecular delocalized orbitals.},

To identify which theoretical framework of the chromophore--protein complex can realistically capture its essence, we employ here a variety of electronic-structure methods, namely, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), multireference perturbation theory (NEVPT2 and CASPT2), and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) in combination with static point charges (QM/MM), DFT embedding (QM/DFT), and classical polarizable embedding through induced dipoles (QM/MMpol). Since structural modifications can significantly affect the photophysics of GFP, we also account for thermal fluctuations through extensive molecular dynamics simulations. We find that a treatment of the protein through static point charges leads to significantly blue-shifted excitation energies and that including...},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of protein receptors have become an attractive tool for rational drug discovery. However, the high computational cost of employing molecular dynamics trajectories in virtual screening of large repositories threats the feasibility of this task. Computational intelligence techniques have been applied in this context, with the ultimate goal of reducing the overall computational cost so the task can become feasible. Particularly, clustering algorithms have been widely used as a means to reduce the dimensionality of molecular dynamics trajectories. In this paper, we develop a novel methodology for clustering entire trajectories using structural features from the substrate-binding cavity of the receptor in order to optimize docking experiments on a cloud-based environment. The resulting partition was selected based on three clustering validity criteria, and it was further validated by analyzing the interactions between 20 ligands and a fully flexible receptor (FFR) model containing a 20 ns molecular dynamics simulation trajectory. Our proposed methodology shows that taking into account features of the substrate-binding cavity as input for the k-means algorithm is a promising technique for accurately selecting ensembles of representative structures tailored to a specific ligand.},

In this topical review, we focus on some recent advances in this field related to the computation of condensed phase systems, their excited states, and the evaluation of many-body interactions between the subsystems. As subsystem DFT is in principle an exact theory, any advance in this field can have a dual role. One is the possible applicability of a resulting method in practical calculations. The other is the possibility of shedding light on some quantum-mechanical phenomenon which is more easily treated by subdividing a supersystem into subsystems. An example of the latter is many-body interactions. In the discussion, we present some recent work from our research group as well as some new results, casting them in the current state-of-the-art in this review as comprehensively as possible.},

The Amber ff99SB force field improved protein secondary structure balance and dynamics from earlier force fields like ff99, but weaknesses in side chain rotamer and backbone secondary structure preferences have been identified. Here, we performed a complete refit of all amino acid side chain dihedral parameters, which had been carried over from ff94. The training set of conformations included multidimensional dihedral scans designed to improve transferability of the parameters. Improvement in all amino acids was obtained as compared to ff99SB. Parameters were also generated for alternate protonation states of ionizable side chains. Average errors in relative energies of pairs of conformations were under 1.0 kcal/mol as compared to QM, reduced 35% from ff99SB. We also took the opportunity to make empirical adjustments to the protein backbone dihedral parameters as compared to ff99SB. Multiple small adjustments of $\phi$ and $\psi$ parameters were tested against NMR scalar coupling data and secondary structure content for short peptides. The best results were obtained from a physically motivated adjustment to the $\phi$ rotational profile that compensates for lack of ff99SB QM training data in the $\beta$-ppII transition region. Together, these backbone and side chain modifications (hereafter called ff14SB) not only better reproduced their benchmarks, but also improved secondary structure content in small peptides and reproduction of NMR $\chi$1 scalar coupling measurements for proteins in solution. We also discuss the Amber ff12SB parameter set, a preliminary version of ff14SB that includes most of its improvements.},

Working equations are presented for CC2 ground-state energies and approximate coupled excitation energies, which are a necessary prerequisite for investigations of potential energy surfaces (PESs) of both ground and excited states. The approach is applicable to all systems that can be decomposed into interacting individual molecules for which the RICC2 calculation itself is feasible. Because of the absence of exact exchange in the formalism and the possibility to efficiently evaluate Coulomb coupling integrals using density fitting or a dipole approximation, the coupling step is insignificant in terms of computation time.},

It has been revealed that the lower vinylogues indeed have negative solvatochromism in the full range of solvent polarities starting from n-hexane, while the hexamethinemerocyanine exhibits reversed solvatochromism. With the extreme ranges of solvatochromism, the studied dyes possess 5-7 times weaker solvatofluorochromism, which can be rationalized via their decreased dipolarity in the fluorescent state. They also demonstrate an inverse dependence of their fluorescence quantum yield on solvent polarity and have near-record Stokes shifts in high-polarity media. The experimental data are supplemented by the results of DFT quantum chemical analysis of dye electronic structures in both the ground and excited states with PCM solvent field simulation.},

Quantum mechanical studies have played a key role in interpretating the results of modern time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy, and in elucidating the main photoactivated reactive paths. This review provides a concise, complete picture of the computational studies carried out, approximately, in the past decade. We start with an overview of the photophysics of the nucleobases in the gas phase and in solution. We discuss the proposed mechanisms for ultrafast decay to the ground state, that involve conical intersections, consider the role of triplet states, and analyze how the solvent modulates the photophysics. Then we move to larger systems, from dinucleotides to single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides. We focus on the possible role of charge transfer and delocalized or excitonic states in the photophysics of these systems and discuss the main photochemical paths. We finish with an outlook on the current challenges in the field and future directions of research.},

abstract = {As the length of molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories grows with increasing computational power, so does the importance of clustering methods for partitioning trajectories into conformational bins. Of the methods available, the vast majority require users to either have some a priori knowledge about the system to be clustered or to tune clustering parameters through trial and error. Here we present non-parametric uses of two modern clustering techniques suitable for first-pass investigation of an MD trajectory. Being non-parametric, these methods require neither prior knowledge nor parameter tuning. The first method, HDBSCAN, is fast-relative to other popular clustering methods-and is able to group unstructured or intrinsically disordered systems (such as intrinsically disordered proteins, or IDPs) into bins that represent global conformational shifts. HDBSCAN is also useful for determining the overall stability of a system-as it tends to group stable systems into one or two bins-and identifying transition events between metastable states. The second method, iMWK-Means, with explicit rescaling followed by K-Means, while slower than HDBSCAN, performs well with stable, structured systems such as folded proteins and is able to identify higher resolution details such as changes in relative position of secondary structural elements. Used in conjunction, these clustering methods allow a user to discern quickly and without prior knowledge the stability of a simulated system and identify both local and global conformational changes.},

Due to inhomogeneity of the non-electrostatic component of the total energy:), the expectation value of the embedding potential is not equal to the corresponding component of the total energy. The differences are evaluated using local and semi-local approximations for the functional EnadxcT[?A, ?B] in two model systems representing embedded species weakly interacting with the environment. It is found that ?nadxcT is typically one order of magnitude smaller than EnadxcT[?A, ?B] and decreases with the overlap between and. The kinetic- and exchange-correlation contributions to ?nadxcT cancel partially reducing its magnitude to mHartrees. Compared to local approximation for EnadxcT[?A, ?B], the inhomogeneity is more pronounced in semi-local functionals.},

We apply a recent analysis to both Kohn-Sham and orbital-free DFT, as well as to partition DFT, which generalizes all aspects of standard DFT. In each case, the analysis distinguishes between errors in approximate functionals versus errors in the self-consistent density. This yields insights into the origins of many errors in DFT calculations, especially those often attributed to self-interaction or delocalization error. In many classes of problems, errors can be substantially reduced by using better densities. We review the history of these approaches, discuss many of their applications, and give simple pedagogical examples.},

abstract = {Channelrhodopsins are light-sensitive ion channels whose reaction cycles involve conformation-coupled transfer of protons. Understanding how channelrhodopsins work is important for applications in optogenetics, where light activation of these proteins triggers changes in the transmembrane potential across excitable membranes. A fundamental open question is how the protein environment ensures that unproductive proton transfer from the retinal Schiff base to the nearby carboxylate counterion is avoided in the resting state of the channel. To address this question, we performed combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical proton transfer calculations with explicit treatment of the surrounding lipid membrane. The free energy profiles computed for proton transfer to the counterion, either via a direct jump or mediated by a water molecule, demonstrate that, when retinal is all-trans, water and protein electrostatic interactions largely favour the protonated retinal Schiff base state. We identified a conserved lysine group as an essential structural element for the proton transfer energetics in channelrhodopsins.},

abstract = {Crystallography and quantum mechanics have always been tightly connected because reliable quantum mechanical models are needed to determine crystal structures. Due to this natural synergy, nowadays accurate distributions of electrons in space can be obtained from diffraction and scattering experiments. In the original definition of quantum crystallography (QCr) given by Massa, Karle and Huang, direct extraction of wavefunctions or density matrices from measured intensities of reflections or, conversely, ad hoc quantum mechanical calculations to enhance the accuracy of the crystallographic refinement are implicated. Nevertheless, many other active and emerging research areas involving quantum mechanics and scattering experiments are not covered by the original definition although they enable to observe and explain quantum phenomena as accurately and successfully as the original strategies. Therefore, we give an overview over current research that is related to a broader notion of QCr, and discuss options how QCr can evolve to become a complete and independent domain of natural sciences. The goal of this paper is to initiate discussions around QCr, but not to find a final definition of the field.},

abstract = {Charge-transfer (CT) is an important binding force in the formation of intermolecular complexes, and there have been a variety of theoretical models proposed to quantify this effect. These approaches, which typically rely on a definition of a “CT-free” state based on a partition of the system, sometimes yield significantly different results for a given intermolecular complex. Two widely used definitions of the “CT-free” state, the absolutely localized molecular orbitals (ALMO) method (where only on-fragment orbital mixings are permitted) and the constrained density functional theory (CDFT) approach (where fragment electron populations are fixed), are carefully examined in this work. Natural bond orbital (NBO) and the regularized symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) are also briefly considered. Results for the ALMO and CDFT definitions of CT are compared on a broad range of model systems, including hydrogen-bonding systems, borane complexes, metal–carbonyl complexes, and complexes formed by water and metal cations. For most of these systems, CDFT yields a much smaller equilibrium CT energy compared to that given by the ALMO-based definition. This is mainly because the CDFT population constraint does not fully inhibit CT, which means that the CDFT “CT-free” state is in fact CT-contaminated. Examples of this contamination include (i) matching forward and backward donation (e.g., formic acid dimer) and (ii) unidirectional CT without changing fragment populations. The magnitude of the latter effect is quantified in systems such as the water dimer by employing a 3-space density constraint in addition to the orbital constraint. Furthermore, by means of the adiabatic EDA, it is shown that several observable effects of CT, such as the “pyramidalization” of the planar BH3 molecule upon the complexation with Lewis bases, already appear on the “CT-free” CDFT surface. These results reveal the essential distinctions between the ALMO and CDFT definitions of CT and suggest that the former is more consistent with accepted understanding of the role of CT in intermolecular binding.},

The presented PE-ADC method is implemented through second and third order and is designed with the aim of performing accurate calculations of excited states in large molecular systems. Accuracy and large-scale applicability are demonstrated with three case studies, and we further analyze the importance of both state-specific and linear-response-type corrections to the excitation energies in the presence of the polarizable environment. We demonstrate how our combined method can be readily applied to study photo-induced biochemical processes as we model the charge-transfer (CT) excitation which is key to the photoprotection mechanism in the dodecin protein with PE-ADC(2). Through direct access to state-of-the-art excited state analysis, we find that the polarizable environment plays a decisive role by significantly increasing the CT character of the electronic excitation in dodecin. PE-ADC is thus suited to decipher photoinduced processes in complex, biomolecular systems at high precision and at reasonable computational cost.},

The study was carried out on a set of 52 intermolecular complexes with varying interaction strength, each consisting of a chromophore of fundamental interest and a few small molecules in its environment. The errors emerging in frozen-density embedding theory-based methods originate from (a) the solver of the quantum many-body problem used to obtain the embedded wave function ($\Psi$ A emb), (b) the approximation for the explicit density functional for the embedding potential, and (c) the choice of the density representing the environment ($\rho_B (r)$). The present work provides a comprehensive analysis of the errors in the excitation energies based on the last two factors. Furthermore, a density-overlap-based parameter is proposed to be used as an a priori criterion of applicability.},

Monostable rhodopsins release retinal upon isomerization as opposed to the retinal in bistable rhodopsins that “reisomerize” upon absorption of a second photon. Understanding the mechanistic differences between these light-sensitive GPCRs has been hindered by the scarcity of recombinant models of the latter. Here, we reveal the high-resolution crystal structure of a recombinant bistable rhodopsin, jumping spider rhodopsin-1, bound to the inverse agonist 9-cis retinal. We observe a water-mediated network around the ligand hinting toward the basis of their bistable nature. In contrast to bovine rhodopsin (monostable), the transmembrane bundle of jumping spider rhodopsin-1 as well that of the bistable squid rhodopsin adopts a more “activation-ready” conformation often observed in other nonphotosensitive class A GPCRs. These similarities suggest the role of jumping spider rhodopsin-1 as a potential model system in the study of the structure–function relationship of both photosensitive and nonphotosensitive class A GPCRs.},

abstract = {Clustering Molecular Dynamics trajectories is a common analysis that allows grouping together similar conformations. Several algorithms have been designed and optimized to perform this routine task, and among them, Quality Threshold stands as a very attractive option. This algorithm guarantees that in retrieved clusters no pair of frames will have a similarity value greater than a specified threshold, and hence, a set of strongly correlated frames are obtained for each cluster. In this work, it is shown that various commonly used software implementations are flawed by confusing Quality Threshold with another simplistic well-known clustering algorithm published by Daura et al. (Daura, X.; van Gunsteren, W. F.; Jaun, B.; Mark, A. E.; Gademann, K.; Seebach, D. Peptide Folding: When Simulation Meets Experiment. Angew. Chemie Int. Ed. 1999, 38 (1/2), 236-240). Daura's algorithm does not impose any quality threshold for the frames contained in retrieved clusters, bringing unrelated structural configurations altogether. The advantages of using Quality Threshold whenever possible to explore Molecular Dynamic trajectories is exemplified. An in-house implementation of the original Quality Threshold algorithm has been developed in order to illustrate our comments, and its code is freely available for further use by the scientific community.},

abstract = {Channelrhodopsins are photosensitive proteins that trigger flagella motion in single-cell algae and have been successfully utilized in optogenetic applications. In optogenetics, light is used to activate neural cells in living organisms, which can be achieved by exploiting the ion channel signaling of channelrhodopsins. Tailoring channelrhodopsins for such applications includes the tuning of the absorption maximum. In order to establish rational design and to obtain a desired spectral shift, a basic understanding of the absorption spectrum is required. We have studied the chimera C1C2 as a representative of this protein family and the first member with an available crystal structure. For this purpose, we sampled the conformations of C1C2 using quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical molecular dynamics and subjected the resulting snapshots of the trajectory to excitation energy calculations using ADC(2) and simplified time-dependent density functional theory. In contrast to previous reports, we found that different hydrogen-bonding networks - involving the retinal protonated Schiff base, the putative counterions E162 and D292, and water molecules - had only a small impact on the absorption spectrum. However, in the case of deprotonated E162, increasing the distance to the Schiff base hydrogen-bonding partner led to a systematic blue shift. The $\beta$-ionone ring rotation was identified as another important contributor. Yet the most important factors were found to be the bond length alternation and bond order alternation that were linearly correlated to the absorption maximum by up to 62 and 82\%, respectively. We ascribe this novel insight into the structural basis of the absorption spectrum to our enhanced protein setup that includes membrane embedding as well as long and extensive sampling.},

The technique is characterized by the application of the previously reported "average electrostatic solvent configuration"method, and it is based on the idea of using the free energy perturbation theory along with a chromophore annihilation procedure in thermodynamic cycle calculations. The method is benchmarked by computing the ground-state room-temperature relative stabilities between (i) the cis and trans isomers of prototypal animal and microbial rhodopsins and (ii) the analogue isomers of a rhodopsin-like light-driven molecular switch in methanol. Furthermore, we show that the same technology can be used to estimate the activation free energy for the thermal isomerization of systems i-ii by replacing one isomer with a transition state. The results show that the computed relative stability and isomerization barrier magnitudes for the selected systems are in line with the available experimental observation in spite of their widely diverse complexity.},

The increase in computational speed has allowed the expanded use of more complicated and accurate methods for both QM and MM simulations.

abstract = {The extension of the frozen-density embedding theory for nonvariational methods [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2020, 16, 6880] was utilized to evaluate intermolecular interaction energies for complexes in the Zhao-Truhlar basis set. In the applied method (FDET-MP2-FAT-LDA), the same auxiliary system is used to evaluate the correlation energy by means of the second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), as in our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 2019, 150, 121101]. Local density approximation is used for ExcTnad[$\rho$A,$\rho$B] in both cases. Additionally, the contribution to the energy due to the neglected correlation potential was evaluated and analyzed. The domain of applicability of the local density approximation for ExcTnad[$\rho$A,$\rho$B] was determined based on deviations from the interaction energies from the conventional MP2 calculations. The local density approximation for ExcTnad[$\rho$A,$\rho$B] performs well for hydrogen- or dipole-bound complexes. The relative errors in the interaction energy lie within 3-30%. While for charge-transfer complexes, this approximation fails consistently, and for other types of complexes, the performance of this approximation is not systematic. The sources of error are discussed in detail.},
