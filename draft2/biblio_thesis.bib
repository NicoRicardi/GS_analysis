abstract = {Until our knowledge of the disposition and motion of the electrons in atoms and molecules is more complete, we cannot hope to make a direct calculation of the nature of the forces called into play during an encounter between molecules in a gas. It is true that a step in this direction has recently been made by Debye, who has investigated the nature of the field in the neighbourood of a hydrogen atom, assumed to consist of a negative charge in motion in circular orbit about a positive nucleus, and has shown how the pulsating eld gives rise on the whole to a force of repulsion, as well as one of attraction n a unit negative charge. But it is difficult to see how this work can be extended to more complex systems. At present we can only hope to derive information by more indirect methods. One such method is to assume a definite law of force, and then by the methods of the kinetic theory to deduce the appropriate law of dependence of the viscosity of a gas on temperature. Comparison with the actual law, as observed experimentally, serves to support or discredit the assumed law of molecular interaction. Unfortunately, the calculations involved in the application of be kinetic theory are so complicated that progress has been made only in certain simple cases. Thus, the original investigation by Maxwell applied only to molecules repelling as the inverse fifth power law. His work has since be generalised by Chapman and Enskog and formulæ have been obtained: the coefficient of viscosity in the case of (i) molecules, which repel according an inverse nth power law, (ii) molecules which behave on collision like rig elastic spheres and (iii) molecules which behave as rigid elastic spheres with weak attractive field of force surrounding them. Of these models the la generally referred to as Sutherland’s model, is found to give the best agreement between theory and experiment. But the agreement is by no means perfe As Schmidt, Bestelmeyer, Vogel, and others have pointed out, there considerable divergence from observed values a t low temperatures. }

abstract = { The approximate self-consistent field equations of Roothaan (1951) are, studied from the standpoint of density matrix theory. Their direct solution, which entails repeated determination of the individual occupied orbitals, is shown to be quite unnecessary. All information about the system under consideration can be obtained in terms of a one-particle density matrix; and this can be constructed by an iterative method which involves only matrix algebra. As an illustration of the method, the ground state of the beryllium atom is calculated. The solution, which is approximated in a basis of four Slater functions, surpasses in accuracy all other analytical one-determinant wave functions so far available, with one exception (Holöien, 1955). And although it approaches the accurate solution of the Hartree-Fock equations the computation required is relatively small. Extensions of the method, in order to admit configuration-interaction calculations, are also discussed. An appendix introduces a ‘steepest descent’ method of solving eigenvalence problems, which may be regarded as the prototype of the iterative construction described in the paper. }

In the chapter, the augmented plane wave, orthogonalized plane wave, Ziman, and Abarenkov forms are discussed.

Free energy terms are introduced to account for “specific hydration” due to water–solute hydrogen bonding and for “nonspecific hydration” describing the interaction of the solute with water molecules in a first‐neighbor shell. The dielectric constant has been doubled (over the value used for calculations in the absence of water) to take into account the presence of solvent. Computations were carried out for the N‐acetyl‐N′‐methylamides of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. Conformational energy maps are compared with similar maps calculated in the absence of hydration. Minimum‐energy conformations are located and compared with the corresponding minima for unhydrated peptides in terms of ordering with respect to potential energy, the dihedral angles at the minima, and the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The Boltzmann factors for various conformational regions are altered significantly on hydration in some cases. These changes can be explained in terms of differences in the hydration free energy terms for various conformations. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1979 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Universal variational functionals of densities, first-order density matrices, and natural spin-orbitals are explicitly displayed for variational calculations of ground states of interacting electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus [Formula: see text] is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron—electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density ρ. Q[ρ] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions Ψρ which yield the fixed. ρ. Q[ρ] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electron—electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix γ, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree—Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.}}

Empirical parameters of solvent polarity are of great value in this respect and can be derived with the aid of the principle of “linear relationships between free energies” (LFE relationships). The present article deals with the possibilities of establishing reaction and absorption series using solvent‐dependent standard reactions or standard absorptions of organic compounds. Particular attention is merited by the summary of the 24 most important empirical parameters of solvent polarity and the table of ET(30) values for 151 solvents. In addition to examples of the application of these values, attempts to improve the LFE correlations of singular empirical parameters of solvent polarity with the aid of multiparametric equations are described.

This approach makes explicit use of the diagrammatic perturbation expansion for the polarization propagator, and reformulates the exact summation in terms of a simple algebraic scheme, referred to as the algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC). The ADC defines in a natural way a set of approximation schemes (nth-order ADC schemes) which represent infinite partial summations exact up to nth order of perturbation theory. In contrast to the randomphase- approximation (RPA)-like schemes, the corresponding mathematical procedures are essentially Hermitian eigenvalue problems in limited configuration spaces of unperturbed excited configurations. Explicit equations for the first- and second-order ADC schemes are derived. These schemes are thoroughly discussed and compared with the Tamm- Dancoff approximation and RPA schemes.},

The results are strictly equivalent to the canonical formulation if no further approximations are introduced. The new formalism permits the extension of the local correlation method to M{\o}ller-Plesset theory. It also facilitates the treatment of weak pairs at a lower (e.g., second order) level of theory in CI and coupled cluster methods. Based on our formalism, an MP2 gradient algorithm is outlined which does not require the storage of derivative integrals, integrals with three external MO indices, and, using the method of Handy and Schaefer, the repeated solution of the coupled-perturbed SCF equations. {\textcopyright} 1986 Springer-Verlag.},

Unlike previous localized perturbation theories, our formulation is strictly identical with canonical MP4 theory if no further approximations are made. In the local treatment, large savings can be achieved by two techniques: (1) neglecting or treating at a lower (second order) level pair correlation between distant pairs, and (2) restricting the correlation basis to the atomic orbitals in the spatial vicinity of the correlated pair. These techniques have been used in our previous local correlation treatment for variational CI, coupled electron pair (CEPA), and approximate coupled cluster (ACCD) wave functions. The MP4 method is more economical than these techniques because of the absence of iterative cycles. Implementation with single, double, and quadruple substitutions is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1986 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In the development of the MM3 force field, vibrational frequencies were considered for a set of eight relatively simple hydrocarbons. The 213 observed experimental frequencies over this set were fit to within a root-mean-square error of 35 cm-1, of which the largest errors occur in the C-C-H bending frequencies. The torsional frequencies are generally calculated to a much higher accuracy, which allows the calculation of entropies near room temperature for a variety of alkanes and cycloalkanes with errors of less than 1%. A number of rotational barriers in hindered compounds were also calculated. The values of AS* are usually more negative than -4 eu in congested molecules, and consequently the entropy contribution to rotational barriers can be appreciable. The largest and average discrepancies between the calculated and found values for AG* are 2.46 and 1.02 kcal/mol, for seven examples. {\textcopyright} 1989, American Chemical Society.

abstract = {An improved method for computing potential-derived charges is described which is based upon the CHELP program available from QCPE.1 This approach (CHELPG) is shown to be considerably less dependent upon molecular orientation than the original CHELP program. In the second part of this work, the CHELPG point selection algorithm was used to analyze the changes in the potential-derived charges in formamide during rotation about the C---N bond. In order to achieve a level of rotational invariance less than 10{\%} of the magnitude of the electronic effects studied, an equally-spaced array of points 0.3 {\AA} apart was required. Points found to be greater than 2.8 {\AA} from any nucleus were eliminated, along with all points contained within the defined VDW distances from each of the atoms. The results are compared to those obtained by using CHELP. Even when large numbers of points (ca. 3000) were sampled using the CHELP selection routine, the results did not indicate a satisfactory level of rotatational invariance. On the basis of these results, the original CHELP program was found to be inadequate for analyzing internal rotations.},

These interactions can be non-specific (dielectric interactions) when they depend only on multiple and polarizability properties of the solute and solvent molecules; but specific associations such as hydrogen bonding can also be important. A number of examples of solvatochromic shifts are shown and discussed according to the various solute-medium interactions. The properties of solvent mixtures and those of rigid media are considered, as well as the ``thermochromic shifts'' which result from the change in the temperature of the medium. The use of solvatochromic shifts for the determination of the dipole moment and of the polarizability of electronically excited molecules has been important for an understanding of electron distribution changes in such states; examples of such determinations are given, together with references to the original literature. In the final section some limitations of the theories of solvent shifts and possible improvements are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Methods for calculations on extended systems are proposed, in which long‐range Coulombic interactions are treated classically. The basic mode of description for the system is still in a quantum mechanical language, involving wave functions, Hamiltonians, etc. The electron density in a large molecular system is divided into suitable fragments, and the electrostatic potential generated by such a fragment at some distance away from it is then expressed by a generalized multipole expansion relative to a single point in space, conveniently taken as the center of charge distribution for that fragment. The computational effort required for evaluating the interactions involving those multipoles is modest and scales favorably (quadratically) with the size of the system. The remaining interactions, which need to be treated with conventional methods, i.e., with explicit one‐ and two‐electron integrals, scale only linearly with size in extended systems. An important characteristic of the approach is that, while the approximations and shortcuts introduced have a clear physical origin, they can be justified on strict numerical grounds, such that calculated energies and other properties are identical to those obtained with conventional methods.

abstract = {We propose fuzzy clustering as a method to analyze molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, especially of proteins and polypeptides. A fuzzy cluster analysis locates classes of similar three‐dimensional conformations explored during a molecular dynamics simulation. The method can be readily applied to results from both equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulations, with clustering on either global or local structural parameters. The potential of this technique is illustrated by results from fuzzy cluster analyses of trajectories from MD simulations of various fragments of human parathyroid hormone (PTH). For large molecules, it is more efficient to analyze the clustering of root‐mean‐square distances between conformations comprising the trajectory. We found that the results of the clustering analysis were unambiguous, in terms of the optimal number of clusters of conformations, for the majority of the trajectories examined. The conformation closest to the cluster center can be chosen as being representative of the class of structures making up the cluster, and can be further analyzed, for example, in terms of its secondary structure. The CPU time used by the cluster analysis was negligible compared to the MD simulation time. {\textcopyright} 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {An efficient ab initio method for electronic structure calculations on extended molecular systems is presented, along with some illustrative applications. A division of the system into subunits allows the interactions to be separated into short‐ and long‐range contributions, leading to a reduction of the computational effort from the original fourth‐power size‐dependence to one that is approximately quadratic. The short‐range contributions to the Fock matrix are obtained in an essentially conventional fashion, while the long‐range interactions are evaluated using a two‐center multipole expansion formalism. The number of short‐range contributions grows only linearly with the number of subunits, while the long‐range contributions grow as N2. Systematic studies of the computational efforts for systems of up to 99 water molecules organized as one‐stranded chains, three‐stranded chains, and three‐dimensional clusters, as well as alkane chains with up to 69 carbon atoms, have been performed. In these model systems, the overall computational effort grows as NK where 1 < K < 2. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1992 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Abstract A computational approach, which involves the combination of the OPLS force field and molecular orbital MNDO, AM1, and PM3 methods, has been developed to describe the effects of a large, molecular mechanically simulated environment on the Hamiltonian of a quantum chemical system. To test the validity of the combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) potential, a systematic study of the structures and energies of neutral and charged hydrogen-bonded complexes has been carried out, including comparisons with pure semiempirical calculations and available experimental and ab initio data. It is shown that, in many cases, the hybrid QM/MM potential behaves better than do related MNDO/M, AM1, and PM3 methods. As a case in point, the draw-back of AM1 favoring bifurcated H-bonded structures over single ones is not presented in the combined AM1/OPLS scheme. Possible ways of improvement of the combined QM/MM potential are discussed. © 1992 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Correlated densities from M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory to second-order (MP2), configuration interaction with single and double excitations (CISD) and quadratic CI (QCI) were obtained from the Z density, an effective density matrix which represents the response of the correlated system to any one-electron perturbation. These densities are compared with densities derived by integrating the CI wave function and with SCF densities. The difference between the Z density and the unrelaxed density is usually small, but it is significant in some instances. The change in density is exaggerated by MP2 compared to CISD or QCI. The unusual cases of CO (in which different correlation methods give substantially different dipoles) and malonaldehyde enol (in which the hydrogen bond geometry changes significantly on inclusion of correlation) are examined in detail.},

@article{Karpen1993,
abstract = {The microscopic interactions and mechanisms leading to nascent protein folding events are generally unknown. While such short time-scale events are difficult to study experimentally, molecular dynamics simulations of peptides can provide a useful model for studying events related to protein folding initiation. Recently, two extremely long molecular dynamics simulations (2.2 ns each) were carried out on the pentapeptide Tyr-Pro-Gly-Asp-Val [Tobias, D. J., Mertz, J. E., \& Brooks, C. L., III (1991) Biochemistry 30, 6054–6058] that forms stable reverse turns in solution. Tobias et al. examined folding events in this large system (∼ 30 000 conformations) using traditional methods of trajectory analysis. The shear magnitude of this problem prompted us to develop an automated approach, based on self-organizing neural nets, to extract the key features of the molecular dynamics trajectory. The neural net is used to perform conformational clustering, which reduces the complexity of a system while minimizing the loss of information. The conformations were grouped together using distances in dihedral angle space as a measure of conformational similarity. The resulting clusters represent “conformational states”, and transitions between these states were examined to identify mechanisms of conformational change. Many conformational changes involved the rotation of only a single dihedral angle, but concerted angle changes were also found. Most of the conformational information in the 30 000 samples from the full trajectories was retained in the relatively few resultant clusters, providing a powerful tool for analysis of an expanding base of large molecular simulations. {\textcopyright} 1993, American Chemical Society.

abstract = {This paper describes a computational strategy for the superposition of a set of flexible molecules. The combinatorial problems of searching conformational space and molecular matching are reduced drastically by the combined use of simulated annealing methods and cluster analysis. For each molecule, the global minimum of the conformational energy is determined by annealing and the search trajectory is retained in a history file. All the significantly different low-energy conformations are extracted by cluster analysis of data in the history file. Each pair of molecules, in each of their significantly different conformations, is then matched by simulated annealing, using the difference-distance matrix as the objective function. A set of match statistics is then obtained, from which the best match taken from all different conformations can be found. The molecules are then superposed either by reference to a base molecule or by a consensus method. This strategy ensures that as wide a range of conformations as possible is considered, but at the same time that the smallest number of significantly different conformations is used. The method has been tested on a set of six angiotensin II antagonists with between 7-11 rotatable bonds. {\textcopyright} 1993 ESCOM Science Publishers B.V.},

abstract = {Quantum chemical computations on a subset of a large molecule can be performed, at the neglect of diatomic differential overlap (NDDO) level, without further approximation provided that the atomic orbitals of the frontier atoms are replaced by parametrized orthogonal hybrid orbitals. The electrostatic interaction with the rest of the molecule, treated classically by the usual molecular mechanical approximations, is included into the self‐consistent field (SCF) equations. The first and second derivatives of energy are obtained analytically, allowing the search for energy minima and transition states as well as the resolution of Newton equations in molecular dynamics simulations. The local self‐consistent field (LSCF) method based on these approximations is tested by studying the intramolecular proton transfer in a Gly‐Arg‐Glu‐Gly model tetrapeptide, which reveals an excellent agreement between a computation performed on the whole molecule and the results obtained by the present method, especially if the quantum subsystem includes the side chains and the peptidic unit in between. The merits of the LSCF method are examplified by a study of proton transfer in the Asp69—Arg71 salt bridge in dihydrofolate reductase. Simulations of large systems, involving local changes of electronic structure, are therefore possible at a good degree of approximation by introducing a quantum chemical part in molecular dynamics studies. This methodology is expected to be very useful for reactivity studies in biomolecules or at the surface of covalent solids. {\textcopyright} 1994 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

abstract = {We present a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics study of dimethyl ether (DME) and 18-crown-6 (18c6) interacting with K+. The QM/MM method employs the semiempirical AM1 method to describe the ethers, the MM parametrization of Dang for K+, and the MM SPC/e model for H2O. We parametrize the interaction Hamiltonian to the binding energies and optimized geometries for K+/DME using ab initio HF and MP2/6-31+G* results. The resulting QM/MM model describes the polarization response of both free DME and K+-complexed DME well. The QM/MM model gives good agreement with the experimental and ab initio structures for K+/18c6. We calculate gas-phase K+/18c6 binding energies of -70.2 and -72.0 kcal/mol with the QM/MM and MP2/6-31+G* (CP corrected) methods, respectively. Our simulation results for K+/18c6 in H2O show that the most probable K+/18c6 center-of-mass displacement is 0.25 {\AA}, in marked contrast to previous molecular dynamics results of Dang and Kollman. Our result is consistent with K+ having an optimal "fit" for the cavity of 18c6. Still, we find that K+ retains significant solvent accessibility coordinating two H2O molecules, on average, in the K+/18c6 simulation. The simulation average polarization energy for 18c6 interacting with both K+ and the H2O solvent is -14.9 kcal/mol, which is 17% of the total electrostatic interaction energy. This result underscores the potential importance of QM in describing the solution chemistry of ion-macrocycle interactions. Our study is the first simulation of crown ethers that explicitly incorporates QM in the force field. {\textcopyright} 1994 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Abstract A general methodology for deriving geometry-dependent atomic charges is presented. The main ingredient of the method is a model that describes the molecular dipole moment in terms of geometry-dependent point charges. The parameters of the model are determined from ab initio calculations of molecular dipole moments and their Cartesian derivatives at various molecular geometries. Transferability of the parameters is built into the model by fitting ab initio calculations for various molecules simultaneously. The results show that charge flux along the bonds is a major contributing factor to the geometry dependence of the atomic charges, with additional contributions from fluxes along valence angles and adjacent bonds. Torsion flux is found to be smaller in magnitude than the bond and valence angle fluxes but is not always unimportant. A set of electrostatic parameters is presented for alkanes, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Transferability of these parameters for a host of molecules is established to within 3 −5\% error in the predicted dipole moments. A possible extension of the method to include atomic dipoles is outlined. With the inclusion of such atomic dipoles and with the set of transferable point charges and charge flux parameters, it is demonstrated that molecular electrostatic potentials as well as electrostatic forces on nuclei can be reproduced much better than is possible with other models (such as potential derived charges). © 1995 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

In this work, quantitative data is presented to illustrate the effects of this integral screening on the scaling properties of the Hartree-Fock (HF) method. Calculations are performed on a range of carbon-hydrogen model systems, two-dimensional graphitic sheets, and three-dimensional diamond pieces, to determine the effective scaling exponent a of the computational expense. The data obtained in this paper for calculations including over 250 carbon atoms and 1500 basis functions shows two significant trends: (1) in the asymptotic limit of large molecules, a is found to be approximately 2.2-2.3, and (2) for molecules of modest size, a is still very much less than 4. Therefore, integral screening is quantitatively shown to substantially reduce the Hartree-Fock scaling from its formal value of N 4. {\textcopyright} 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Using energy minimization and cluster analysis, we have analyzed a 1020 ps molecular dynamics trajectory of solvated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. Elucidation of conformational sub states in this way both illustrates the degree of conformational convergence in the simulation and reduces the structural data to a tractable subset. The relative movement of structures upon energy minimization was used to estimate the sizes of features on the protein potential energy surface. The structures were analyzed using their pairwise root‐mean‐square C$\alpha$ deviations, which gave a global measure of conformational changes that would not be apparent by monitoring single degrees of freedom. At time scales of 0.1 ps, energy minimization detected sharp transitions between energy minima separated by 0.1 {\AA} rms deviation. Larger conformational clusters containing these smaller minima and separated by 0.25 {\AA} were seen at 1 ps time scales. Both of these small features of the conformational landscape were characterized by movements in loop regions associated with small, correlated backbone dihedral angle shifts. On a nanosecond time scale, the main features of the protein energy landscape were clusters separated by over 0.7 {\AA} rms deviation, with only seven of these sub states visited over the 1 ns trajectory. These substates, discernible both before and after energy minimization, differ mainly in a monotonic pivot of the loop residues 11–18 over the course of the simulation. This loop contains lysine 17, which specifically binds to trypsin in the active site. The trajectory did not return to previously visited clusters, indicating that this trajectory has not been shown to have completely sampled the conformational substates available to it. Because the apparent convergence to a single region of conformation space depends on both the time scale of observation and the size of the conformational features examined, convergence must be operationally defined within the context of the simulation. {\textcopyright} 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

abstract = {A new method of deriving higher order MPn correlation energies is presented. Application of this method to MP6 leads to the derivation of the total correlation energy E(6) and its dissection into 36 energy terms EABC(6). For 33 electron systems, for which full CI (FCI) correlation energies are known E(6) and EABC(6) values together with the corresponding MP5 and MP4 energies are computed and used to analyze the initial convergence behavior of the MPn series. Two classes of systems can be distinguished, namely systems with monotonie convergence of the MPn series (class A systems) and systems with initial oscillations in the MPn series (class B systems). Analysis of EA(4), EAB(5), and EABC(6) reveals that oscillations in the MP/i series are caused by similar oscillations in the T contributions. For class A systems, the T contributions are of minor importance and decrease monotonically with order n as do also the SDQ contributions. For class B systems, one observes a significantly increased importance of the T contributions and alternation in the sign of the T energy for n = 4, 5, 6. Results indicate that class A systems are electron systems with wellseparated electron pairs. The most important correlation effects are pair correlations while three-electron correlations and couplings between pair correlations are relatively small. The latter become important when electrons cluster in certain regions of an atom or molecule. Clustering of electrons always means increased electron correlation and a more complicated correlation pattern including three-electron and pair-coupling effects. In this case, MP theory strongly exaggerates correlation effects at even orders n, which is corrected by positive correlation contributions, in particular three-electron contributions at odd orders thus leading to the oscillations observed for class B systems. Once the electron structure of an atom or molecule is understood, it is possible to identify the system as a class A or class B system and to predict the convergence behavior of the corresponding MPn series. If extrapolation formulas are used that do not distinguish between class A and class B systems, the mean deviation from FCI correlation energies is 12 mhartrees. If however, different extrapolation formulas are applied for class A and class B systems, the mean deviation obtained for the same set of molecules decreases to 0.3 mhartree, which corresponds to an improvement of FCI estimates by a factor of 36. {\textcopyright} 1996 American Chemical Society.},

The solvent, which might consist of discrete water molecules, protein, or other material, is treated explicitly using a model potential that incorporates electrostatics, polarization, and exchange repulsion effects. The solute, which one can most generally envision as including some number of solvent molecules as well, is treated in a fully ab initio manner, using an appropriate level of electronic structure theory. Ln addition to the fragment model itself, formulae are presented that permit the determination of analytic energy gradients and, therefore, numerically determined energy second derivatives (hessians) for the complete system. Initial tests of the model for the water dimer and water-formamide are in good agreement with fully ab initio calculations. (C) 1996 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We review the dynamical mean-field theory of strongly correlated electron systems which is based on a mapping of lattice models onto quantum impurity models subject to a self-consistency condition. This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview,of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed. Computer programs for the numerical implementation of this method are also provided with this article.},

A. Wesolowski and J. Weber, Chemical Physics Letters 248, 71, (1996)]. For several geometries of the complex, the electron density and the total energy are compared to the ones obtained by means of the standard Kohn–Sham calculations. The comparisons are made to assess the accuracy of several gradient dependent approximate kinetic energy functionals applied in the KSCED equations. It was found that the closest results to the Kohn–Sham ones were obtained with the functional whose analytical form was proposed by Perdew and Wang for exchange energy [J. P. Perdew and Y. Wang in Electronic Structure of Solids '91, edited by P. Ziesche and H. Eschrig (Academie Verlag, Berlin, 1991), p. 11] and parametrized by Lembarki and Chermette for kinetic energy [A.

abstract = {Computation of the Fock matrix is currently the limiting factor in the application of Hartree-Fock and hybrid Hartree-Fock/density functional theories to larger systems. Computation of the Fock matrix is dominated by calculation of the Coulomb and exchange matrices. With conventional Gaussian-based methods, computation of the Fock matrix typically scales as ∼N2.7, where N is the number of basis functions. A hierarchical multipole method is developed for fast computation of the Coulomb matrix. This method, together with a recently described approach to computing the Hartree-Fock exchange matrix of insulators [The Journal of Chemical Physics 105, 2726 (1900)], leads to a linear scaling algorithm for calculation of the Fock matrix. Linear scaling computation the Fock matrix is demonstrated for a sequence of water clusters at the restricted Hartree-Fock/3-21G level of theory, and corresponding accuracies in converged total energies are shown to be comparable with those obtained from standard quantum chemistry programs. Restricted Hartree-Fock/3-21G calculations on several proteins of current interest are documented, including endothelin, charybdotoxin, and the tetramerization monomer of P53. The P53 calculation, involving 698 atoms and 3836 basis functions, may be the largest Hartree-Fock calculation to date. The electrostatic potentials of charybdotoxin and the tetramerization monomer of P53 are visualized and the results are related to molecular function. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

Monitoring the dependence of the computed properties on the oligomer size provides new insights into the reliability of the calculations, which are analyzed in terms of dynamical and nondynamical electron correlation. Our theoretical bond length alternation values for the oligomers of polyacetylene extrapolate to significantly smaller values than what has been established by experiments and earlier theoretical predictions. The exact exchange mixing to the exchange-correlation functional not only improves the agreement of the theoretical gap of oligoenes with experimental excitation energies but also increases the computed bond length alternations. Based on a newly proposed one parameter functional of Becke, the effect of the exact exchange mixing has been further identified, and a practical measure of nondynamical correlation energy has been suggested. The popular Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr density functional produces bond alternation values that are unacceptably small. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

The addition of lone pairs also results in improved accuracy in relative solvation free energy calculation for the pyridine to benzene and methanol to methane mutations.

abstract = {New protein parameters are reported for the all-atom empirical energy function in the CHARMM program. The parameter evaluation was based on a self-consistent approach designed to achieve a balance between the internal (bonding) and interaction (nonbonding) terms of the force field and among the solvent - solvent, solvent - solute, and solute - solute interactions. Optimization of the internal parameters used experimental gas-phase geometries, vibrational spectra, and torsional energy surfaces supplemented with ab initio results. The peptide backbone bonding parameters were optimized with respect to data for N-methylacetamide and the alanine dipeptide. The interaction parameters, particularly the atomic charges, were determined by fitting ab initio interaction energies and geometries of complexes between water and model compounds that represented the backbone and the various side chains. In addition, dipole moments, experimental heats and free energies of vaporization, solvation and sublimation, molecular volumes, and crystal pressures and structures were used in the optimization. The resulting protein parameters were tested by applying them to noncyclic tripeptide crystals, cyclic peptide crystals, and the proteins crambin, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and carbonmonoxy myoglobin in vacuo and in crystals. A detailed analysis of the relationship between the alanine dipeptide potential energy surface and calculated protein $\phi$, $\chi$ angles was made and used in optimizing the peptide group torsional parameters. The results demonstrate that use of ab initio structural and energetic data by themselves are not sufficient to obtain an adequate backbone representation for peptides and proteins in solution and in crystals. Extensive comparisons between molecular dynamics simulations and experimental data for polypeptides and proteins were performed for both structural and dynamic properties. Energy minimization and dynamics simulations for crystals demonstrate that the latter are needed to obtain meaningful comparisons with experimental crystal structures. The presented parameters, in combination with the previously published CHARMM all-atom parameters for nucleic acids and lipids, provide a consistent set for condensed-phase simulations of a wide variety of molecules of biological interest.},

abstract = {A new algorithm called Mersenne Twister (MT) is proposed for generating uniform pseudorandom numbers. For a particular choice of parameters, the algorithm provides a super astronomical period of 219937 −1 and 623-dimensional equidistribution up to 32-bit accuracy, while using a working area of only 624 words. This is a new variant of the previously proposed generators, TGFSR, modified so as to admit a Mersenne-prime period. The characteristic polynomial has many terms. The distribution up to v bits accuracy for 1 ≤ v ≤ 32 is also shown to be good. An algorithm is also given that checks the primitivity of the characteristic polynomial of MT with computational complexity O(p2) where p is the degree of the polynomial.We implemented this generator in portable C-code. It passed several stringent statistical tests, including diehard. Its speed is comparable to other modern generators. Its merits are due to the efficient algorithms that are unique to polynomial calculations over the two-element field.},

For large molecules, our scheme yields linear scaling computational cost as a function of molecular size. The errors can be controlled in a precise manner and our method reproduces canonical MP2 energies.

abstract = {The thermodynamics of folding and unfolding of a $\beta$-heptapeptide in methanol solution has been studied at four different temperatures, 298 K, 340 K, and 360 K, by molecular dynamics simulation. At each of these temperatures, the 50-ns simulations were sufficient to generate an equilibrium distribution between a relatively small number of conformations ($\sim$102), showing that, even above the melting temperature ($\sim$340 K), the peptide does not randomly sample conformational space. The free energy of folding and the free energy difference between pairs of conformations have been calculated from their relative populations. The experimentally determined folded conformation at 298 K, a left-handed 31-helix, is at each of the four temperatures the predominant conformation, with its probability and average lifetime decreasing with increasing temperature. The most common intermediates of folding and unfolding are also the same at the four temperatures. Paths and rates of interconversion between different conformations have been determined. It has been found that folding can occur through multiple pathways, not necessarily downhill in free energy, although the final step involves a reduced number of intermediates.},

abstract = {Highly correlated configuration interaction (CI) wavefunctions going beyond the simple singles and doubles (CISD) model space can provide very reliable potential energy surfaces, describe electronic excited states, and yield benchmark energies and molecular properties for use in calibrating more approximate methods. Unfortunately, such wavefunctions are also notoriously difficult to evaluate due to their extreme computational demands. The dimension of a full CI procedure, which represents the exact solution of the electronic Schrödinger equation for a fixed one-particle basis set, grows factorially with the number of electrons and basis functions. For very large configuration spaces, the number of CI coupling coefficients becomes prohibitively large to store on disk; these coefficients must be evaluated as needed in a so-called direct CI procedure. Work done by several groups since 1980 has focused on using Slater determinants rather than spin (S^2) eigenfunctions because coupling coefficients are easier to compute with the former. We review the fundamentals of the configuration interaction method and discuss various determinant-based CI algorithms. Additionally, we consider some applications of highly correlated CI methods.}

The electronic structure of the solute in solution and the solvent structure around it are optimized in a self-consistent way. The main characteristics of the proposed method are high-level quantum calculations in the representation of the solute, a detailed description of the solvent structure through molecular dynamics calculation, inclusion of the mutual polarization of the solute and solvent molecules, and an accurate description of the solute-solvent interaction energy. As an application of the model we studied the polarization of quantum mechanically treated water and methanol molecules in the liquid phase. {\textcopyright} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Abstract Five years ago Morokuma and colleagues introduced the IMOMO method, which integrates two molecular orbital methods into one calculation. Since then, the method has been expanded in several ways; it has been generalized to consider up to three methods, and has been unified as the ONIOM method to include both MO and MM combinations. In this review we present the history of the method, a number of chemical problems that we have studied, how to assess IMOMO combinations and partitionings, and our latest efforts that take the method beyond the conventional investigation of ground state energy surfaces. In particular, we emphasize the importance of the S-value test for validation of the ONIOM method/model combinations. The method combination depends much on the properties and accuracies required. Generally speaking, however, if the target level is CCSD(T) or G2, the best choice of low level is MP2. If MP2 or DFT is the target level, HF or eventually semiempirical MO methods are good choices of low level. These methods can be further combined with an outer-most layer of the MM level. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. J Comput Chem 21: 1419–1432, 2000},

abstract = {A wavefunction has been derived for the oxalic acid dihydrate molecule using accurate low-temperature X-ray electron-density structure-factor data. The electron density from this constrained theoretical wavefunction is compared to those of unconstrained theoretical wavefunctions. Fitted electron densities around hydrogen atoms show significant deviation compared to Hartree-Fock calculations. In particular, hydrogen bonding appears enhanced in the crystal over theoretical predictions, while the density usually attributed to lone-pair electrons of the oxalic acid oxygen atoms is decreased. The constrained fitting procedure improves the overall agreement of the calculated structure factors even for structure factors that were not used as input to the fitting procedure. The pictures obtained from the constrained fitting procedure are insensitive to random errors introduced into the data. Similarly, the fitting procedure is able to reproduce features that arise from more accurate theoretical calculations. However, we are unable to fit our wavefunction to within the experimentally quoted error bounds without allowing an unreasonably large change in the energy of the constrained wavefunction. Large Hartree-Fock and density functional theory (DFT) cluster calculations involving up to 86 atoms in size also do not show significantly improved agreement with the experimentally observed structure factors. Derived properties from the constrained wavefunction fragments, such as the kinetic energy, electrostatic potential and the electron localization function, are also presented. In general, there are no difficulties in extracting experimental wavefunctions and the associated derived properties from elastic X-ray scattering data for crystal fragments of the order of 20 atoms.},

abstract = {An experimental wavefunction is one that has an assumed form and that is also fitted to experimental measurements according to some well defined procedure. In this paper, the concept of extracting wavefunctions from experimental data is critically examined and past efforts are reviewed. In particular, the importance of scattering experiments for wavefunction fitting schemes is highlighted in relation to the more familiar model, the Hamiltonian paradigm. A general and systematically improvable method for fitting a wavefunction to experimental data is proposed. In this method, the parameters in a model wavefunction are determined according to the variational theorem but subject to an imposed constraint that an agreement statistic between the calculated and observed experimental data has a certain acceptable value. Advantages of the method include the fact that any amount of experimental data can be used in the fitting procedure irrespective of the number of parameters in the model wavefunction, the fact that a unique answer is obtained for a given choice of the model wavefunction, and the fact that the method can be used to model different experiments simultaneously. The wavefunction fitting method is illustrated by developing the theory for extracting a single-determinant wavefunction for a fragment of a molecular crystal, using data obtained from elastic X-ray scattering data. Effects due to thermal motion of the nuclei, secondary extinction of the X-ray scattering and different choices for the crystal fragment are treated.},

This approach permits the efficient computation of wave functions for large-scale CI matrices by eliminating the need to ever store more than three expansion vectors (bi) and associated matrix-vector products ($\sigma$i), thereby dramatically reducing the I/O requirements relative to the full subspace scheme. The minimal-storage, single-vector method of Olsen is found to be a reasonable alternative for obtaining energies of well-behaved systems to within $\mu$Eh accuracy, although it typically requires around 50% more iterations and at times is too inefficient to yield high accuracy (ca. 10-10 Eh) for very large CI problems. Several approximations to the diagonal elements of the CI Hamiltonian matrix are found to allow simple on-the-fly computation of the preconditioning matrix, to maintain the spin symmetry of the determinant-based wave function, and to preserve the convergence characteristics of the diagonalization procedure.},

abstract = {A new force field has been designed to implement the calculation of Coulomb interactions with fluctuating atomic charges. The charges are calculated by use of a semi-empirical quantum chemical method - bond polarization theory (BPT). The BPT method establishes a direct proportionality between molecular properties, for instance atomic charges or chemical shifts, and bond polarization energies. These energies are calculated from bond orbitals that are constructed for every bond of the force field. Thus the charges depend on the three-dimensional geometry of the molecular system, and it is possible to include all mutual polarizations in the term for electrostatic interaction. The primary goal of this new force field is better description of the intermolecular interactions of molecular systems. No special term within the force field is applied for the description of hydrogen bonds. The inclusion of the polarization effect over the whole system is one of the most important advantages of the method in respect of force fields that divide the molecular system into molecular mechanics and quantum chemical regions. The force field was tested by being used to describe the structure and interaction energies of several small molecular systems (26 hydrogen-bonded dimers) from a web-based ab initio data collection by Halgren. The results show an overall RMS deviation of 2.5 kcal mol-1 for the interaction energies, 0.06 {\AA} for the hydrogen bond distances (X...Z) and 20.1° for the X-H...Z angles. This is comparable with most existing force fields. The results were obtained with the original parametrization of Halgren for the van der Waals interactions without any fine tuning of the interaction parameters. Additional interaction energies and structures of selected DNA/RNA base pairs (see Figure) were studied. The geometries of hydrogen bonds, in particular, are reproduced satisfactorily - after geometry optimization the distances differ on average by 0.06 {\AA} and in the angles by 6° from the ab initio Hartree-Fock results including correlation.},

abstract = {Abstract A new charge analysis is presented that gives an accurate description of the electrostatic potential from the charge distribution in molecules. This is achieved in three steps: first, the total density is written as a sum of atomic densities; next, from these atomic densities a set of atomic multipoles is defined; finally, these atomic multipoles are reconstructed exactly by distributing charges over all atoms. The method is generally applicable to any method able to provide atomic multipole moments, but in this article we take advantage of the way the electrostatic potential is calculated within the Density Functional Theory framework. We investigated a set of 31 molecules as well as all amino acid residues to test the quality of the method, and found accurate results for the molecular multipole moments directly from the DFT calculations. The deviations from experimental values for the dipole/quadrupole moments are also small. Finally, our Multipole Derived Charges reproduce both the atomic and molecular multipole moments exactly. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. J Comput Chem 22: 79–88, 2001},

In the applied approach, CO2 is considered as one subsystem for which the spin-density is obtained using Kohn-Sham-like one-electron effective potential. The KSCED effective embedding potential is expressed using explicit functionals of the electron densities of the considered subsystems. It comprises the terms of known analytic form and the components which are approximated (the exchange-correlation potential and non-additive kinetic energy potential). It is shown that the current implementation of KSCED is applicable to such complexes for which the distribution of the total charge among the interacting subsystems is known. For LiCO2 and NaCO2 which are treated as \${\rm Li}^{+}{\rm CO}^{-}\_{2}\$ and \${\rm Na}^{+}{\rm CO}^{-}\_{2}\$ in KSCED, the KSCED results, the supermolecule Kohn-Sham ones, and the available experimental data are in a very good agreement.}

Emphasis is placed on the roles played by these approximations and how they affect the accuracy and efficiency of the method. Issues affecting the implementation of various order-N procedures, such as the choice of the tight-binding model in the order-N tight-binding approaches and the construction of the Hamiltonian in the order-N ab initio approaches, are also discussed. Some typical examples of applications of the order-N methods to study problems of realistic sizes are presented to provide a glimpse of the capability of utilizing the order-N methods to predict the stable structures and properties of complex systems with reduced symmetry. This review is expected to serve as a clearinghouse where a single resource is provided to help guide the reader to decide, among the existing methodologies, which method can best fulfill the task at hand.}

abstract = {The constrained Hartree-Fock method using experimental X-ray diffraction data is extended and applied to the case of noncentrosymmetric molecular crystals. A new way to estimate the errors in derived properties as a derivative with respect to added Gaussian noise is also described. Three molecular crystals are examined: ammonia [NH3], urea [CO(NH2)2], and alloxan [(CO)4(NH)2]. The energetic and electrical properties of these molecules in the crystalline state are presented. In all cases, an enhancement of the dipole moment is observed upon application of the experimental constraint. It is found that the phases of the structure factors are robustly determined by the constrained Hartree-Fock model, even in the presence of simulated noise. Plots of the electron density, electrostatic potential, and the electron localization function for the molecules in the crystal are displayed. In general, relative to the Hartree-Fock model, there is a depletion of charge around hydrogen atoms and lone pair regions, and a build-up of charge within the molecular framework near nuclei, directed along the bonds. The electron localization function plots reveal an increase in the pair density between vicinal hydrogen atoms.},

abstract = {One of the largest challenges for quantum chemistry today is to obtain accurate results for large complex molecular systems, and a variety of approaches have been proposed recently toward this goal. We have developed the ONIOM method, an onion skin-like multi-level method, combining different levels of quantum chemical methods as well as molecular mechanics method. We have been applying the method to many different large systems, including thermochemistry, homogeneous catalysis, stereoselectivity in organic synthesis, solution chemistry, fullerenes and nanochemistry, and biomolecular systems. The method has recently been combined with the polarizable continuum model (ONIOM-PCM), and was also extended for molecular dynamics simulation of solution (ONIOM-XS). In the present article the recent progress in various applications of ONIOM and other electronic structure methods to problems of homogeneous catalyses and nanochemistry is reviewed. Topics include 1. bond energies in large molecular systems, 2. organometallic reactions and homogeneous catalysis, 3. structure, reactivity and bond energies of large organic molecules including fullerenes and nanotubes, and 4. biomolecular structure and enzymatic reaction mechanisms.},

abstract = {The chapter focuses on a general description of the force fields that are most commonly used at present, and it gives an indication of the directions of current research that may yield better functions in the near future. After a brief survey of current models, mostly generated during the 1990s, the focus of the chapter is on the general directions the field is taking in developing new models. The most commonly used protein force fields incorporate a relatively simple potential energy function: The emphasis is on the use of continuum methods to model the electrostatic effects of hydration and the introduction of polarizability to model the electronic response to changes in the environment. Some of the history and performance of widely used protein force fields based on an equation on simplest potential energy function or closely related equations are reviewed. The chapter outlines some promising developments that go beyond this, primarily by altering the way electrostatic interactions are treated. The use of atomic multipoles and off-center charge distributions, as well as attempts to incorporate electronic polarizability, are also discussed in the chapter.},

abstract = {We report the development of a united AMOEBA (uAMOEBA) polarizable water model, which is computationally 3-5 times more efficient than the three-site AMOEBA03 model in molecular dynamics simulations while providing comparable accuracy for gas-phase and liquid properties. In this coarse-grained polarizable water model, both electrostatic (permanent and induced) and van der Waals representations have been reduced to a single site located at the oxygen atom. The permanent charge distribution is described via the molecular dipole and quadrupole moments and the many-body polarization via an isotropic molecular polarizability, all located at the oxygen center. Similarly, a single van der Waals interaction site is used for each water molecule. Hydrogen atoms are retained only for the purpose of defining local frames for the molecular multipole moments and intramolecular vibrational modes. The parameters have been derived based on a combination of ab initio quantum mechanical and experimental data set containing gas-phase cluster structures and energies, and liquid thermodynamic properties. For validation, additional properties including dimer interaction energy, liquid structures, self-diffusion coefficient, and shear viscosity have been evaluated. The results demonstrate good transferability from the gas to the liquid phase over a wide range of temperatures, and from nonpolar to polar environments, due to the presence of molecular polarizability. The water coordination, hydrogen-bonding structure, and dynamic properties given by uAMOEBA are similar to those derived from the all-atom AMOEBA03 model and experiments. Thus, the current model is an accurate and efficient alternative for modeling water.},

abstract = {On the basis of the Franck-Condon principle, a density functional vertical self-consistent reaction field (VSCRF) solvation model for vertical excitation and emission processes is established. The principles and implementation of the VSCRF model are presented. The predicted blue shifts of the vertical excitation energies of diazines in different solvents from n-heptane to water solutions are compared with the corresponding time dependent density functional calculations and are in very good agreement with experiment. We have also applied this method to predict the blue shifts and the vertical excitation and emission energies of Brooker's merocyanine dye with increasing solvent polarities from CHCl 3 to H 2O solutions. Overall, our calculations predicted the relative excitation and emission energy orderings for Brooker's merocyanine in different solvents with different polarities. Also, the calculated Stokes shift is fairly well represented for different solvents, and the calculations correctly show that the absorption energies have a much stronger solvent dependence than the emission energies. The importance of both relaxation of the molecular structures and consideration of explicit H-bonding H 2O and CH 3OH molecules in water and methanol solvents in predicting the solvatochromic shifts is also discussed.},

@article{Mackerell2004a,
abstract = {Computational studies of proteins based on empirical force fields represent a powerful tool to obtain structure-function relationships at an atomic level, and are central in current efforts to solve the protein folding problem. The results from studies applying these tools are, however, dependent on the quality of the force fields used. In particular, accurate treatment of the peptide backbone is crucial to achieve representative conformational distributions in simulation studies. To improve the treatment of the peptide backbone, quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular mechanical (MM) calculations were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and proline dipeptides, and the results from these calculations were combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins in crystal and aqueous environments. QM potential energy maps of the alanine and glycine dipeptides at the LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G* levels, where x = D, T, and Q, were determined, and are compared to available QM studies on these molecules. The LMP2/cc-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G* energy surfaces for all three dipeptides were then used to improve the MM treatment of the dipeptides. These improvements included additional parameter optimization via Monte Carlo simulated annealing and extension of the potential energy function to contain peptide backbone $\phi$, $\psi$ dihedral crossterms or a $\phi$, $\psi$ grid-based energy correction term. Simultaneously, MD simulations of up to seven proteins in their crystalline environments were used to validate the force field enhancements. Comparison with QM and crystallographic data showed that an additional optimization of the $\phi$, $\psi$ dihedral parameters along with the grid-based energy correction were required to yield significant improvements over the CHARMM22 force field. However, systematic deviations in the treatment of $\phi$ and $\psi$ in the helical and sheet regions were evident. Accordingly, empirical adjustments were made to the grid-based energy correction for alanine and glycine to account for these systematic differences. These adjustments lead to greater deviations from QM data for the two dipeptides but also yielded improved agreement with experimental crystallographic data. These improvements enhance the quality of the CHARMM force field in treating proteins. This extension of the potential energy function is anticipated to facilitate improved treatment of biological macromolecules via MM approaches in general. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Abstract A first-generation fluctuating charge (FQ) force field to be ultimately applied for protein simulations is presented. The electrostatic model parameters, the atomic hardnesses, and electronegativities, are parameterized by fitting to DFT-based charge responses of small molecules perturbed by a dipolar probe mimicking a water dipole. The nonbonded parameters for atoms based on the CHARMM atom-typing scheme are determined via simultaneously optimizing vacuum water-solute geometries and energies (for a set of small organic molecules) and condensed phase properties (densities and vaporization enthalpies) for pure bulk liquids. Vacuum solute-water geometries, specifically hydrogen bond distances, are fit to 0.19 Å r.m.s. error, while dimerization energies are fit to 0.98 kcal/mol r.m.s. error. Properties of the liquids studied include bulk liquid structure and polarization. The FQ model does indeed show a condensed phase effect in the shifting of molecular dipole moments to higher values relative to the gas phase. The FQ liquids also appear to be more strongly associated, in the case of hydrogen bonding liquids, due to the enhanced dipolar interactions as evidenced by shifts toward lower energies in pair energy distributions. We present results from a short simulation of NMA in bulk TIP4P-FQ water as a step towards simulating solvated peptide/protein systems. As expected, there is a nontrivial dipole moment enhancement of the NMA (although the quantitative accuracy is difficult to assess). Furthermore, the distribution of dipole moments of water molecules in the vicinity of the solutes is shifted towards larger values by 0.1–0.2 Debye in keeping with previously reported work. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Propagator methods provide a direct approach to energies and transition moments for (generalized) electronic excitations from the ground state, but they do not usually allow one to determine excited state wave functions and properties. Using a specific intermediate state representation (ISR) concept, we here show how this restriction can be overcome in the case of the algebraic-diagrammatic construction (ADC) propagator approach. In the ISR reformulation of the theory the basic ADC secular matrix is written as a representation of the Hamiltonian (or the shifted Hamiltonian) in terms of explicitly constructable states, referred to as intermediate (or ADC) states. Similar intermediate state representations can be derived for operators other than the Hamiltonian. Together with the ADC eigenvectors, the intermediate states give rise to an explicit formulation of the excited wave functions and allow one to calculate physical properties of excited states as well as transition moments for transitions between different excited states. As for the ground-state excitation energies and transition moments, the ADC excited state properties are size consistent so that the theory is suitable for applications to large systems. The established hierarchy of higher-order [ADC(n)] approximations, corresponding to systematic truncations of the IS configuration space and the perturbation-theoretical expansions of the ISR matrix elements, can readily be extended to the excited state properties. Explicit ISR matrix elements for arbitrary one-particle operators have been derived and coded at the second-order [ADC(2)] level of theory. As a first computational test of the method we have carried out ADC(2) calculations for singlet and triplet excited state dipole moments in H(2)O and HF, where comparison to full CI results can be made. The potential of the ADC(2) method is further demonstrated in an exploratory study of the excitation energies and dipole moments of the low-lying excited states of paranitroaniline. We find that four triplet states, T1-T4, and two singlet states, S1 and S2, lie (vertically) below the prominent charge transfer (CT) excitation, S3. The dipole moment of the S3 state (17.0D) is distinctly larger than that of the corresponding T3 triplet state (11.7D).},

C 6 dispersion coefficients, expressed in terms of the dynamic polarizabilties over the imaginary frequency range ($\alpha$(i$\nu$)), were calculated for a set of homo and hetero dimers. Using these coefficients the dispersion energy has been calculated. The dispersion energy is expressed using a simple London series expansion terminated after the n = 6 term and implemented using distributed localized molecular orbitals (LMOs). The EFP2 dispersion energy is compared to symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) values. From this comparison, it is apparent that one needs to include higher order terms in the dispersion energy. Adding an estimated C8 term to the C 6 energy greatly improves the agreement with the benchmark SAPT energies. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract We present a novel procedure for treating the exchange-correlation contributions in the Kohn–Sham procedure. The approach proposed is fully variational and closely related to the so-called “fitting functions” method for the Coulomb Hartree problem; in fact, the method consistently uses this auxiliary representation of the electron density to determine the exchange-correlation contributions. The exchange-correlation potential and its matrix elements in a basis set of localized (atomic) orbitals can be evaluated by reusing the three-center Coulomb integrals involving fitting functions, while the computational cost of the remaining numerical integration is significantly reduced and scales only linearly with the size of the auxiliary basis. We tested the approach extensively for a large set of atoms and small molecules as well as for transition-metal carbonyls and clusters, by comparing total energies, atomization energies, structure parameters, and vibrational frequencies at the local density approximation and generalized gradient approximation levels of theory. The method requires a sufficiently flexible auxiliary basis set. We propose a minimal extension of the conventional auxiliary basis set, which yields essentially the same accuracy for the quantities just mentioned as the standard approach. The new method allows one to achieve substantial savings compared with a fully numerical integration of the exchange-correlation contributions. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We find for the exact transformed integral products an extremely early onset of a linear-scaling behavior and a very small number of significant products. To preselect the significant integral products we adapt our MBIE method as rigorous upper bound. In this way it is possible to exploit the favorable scaling behavior observed and to reduce the scaling of estimated products asymptotically to linear, without sacrificing accuracy or reliability. By separating Coulomb- and exchange-type contractions only half-transformed integrals need to be computed. Furthermore, our scheme of rigorously preselecting transformed integral products via MBIE seems to offer particularly interesting perspectives for a direct formation of half- or fully transformed integrals by using multipole expansions and auxiliary basis sets. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

For long molecules that are extended in one of their spatial dimensions, we can obtain an exact characterization of correlation, in the given basis, with a cost that scales only quadratically with the size of the system. The reduced scaling is achieved solely through integral screening and without the construction of correlation domains. We demonstrate the scaling, convergence, and robustness of the algorithm in polyenes and hydrogen chains. We converge to exact correlation energies (in the sense of full configuration interaction, with 1-10 $\mu$ Eh precision) in all cases and correlate up to 100 electrons in 100 active orbitals. We further use our algorithm to obtain exact energies for the metal-insulator transition in hydrogen chains and compare and contrast our results with those from conventional quantum chemical methods.{\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The mechanism of color tuning in the rhodopsin family of proteins has been studied by comparing the optical properties of the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin (bR) and the light detector sensory rhodopsin II (sRII). Despite a high structural similarity, the maximal absorption is blue-shifted from 568 nm in bR to 497 nm in sRII. The molecular mechanism of this shift is still a matter of debate, and its clarification sheds light onto the general mechanisms of color tuning in retinal proteins. The calculations employ a combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) technique, using a DFT-based method for ground state properties and the semiempirical OM2/MRCI method and ab initio SORCI method for excited state calculations. The high efficiency of the methodology has allowed us to study a wide variety of aspects including dynamical effects. The absorption shift as well as various mutation experiments and vibrational properties have been successfully reproduced. Our results indicate that several sources contribute to the spectral shift between bR and sRII. The main factors are the counterion region at the extracellular side of retinal and the amino acid composition of the binding pocket. Our analysis allows a distinction and identification of the different effects in detail and leads to a clear picture of the mechanism of color tuning, which is in good agreement with available experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Huang2006a,
abstract = {We present new developments on a density-based embedding strategy for the electronic structure of localized feature in periodic, metallic systems [see T. Kluner et al., The Journal of Chemical Physics 116, 42 (2002), and references therein]. The total system is decomposed into an embedded cluster and a background, where the background density is regarded as fixed. Its effect on the embedded cluster is modeled as a one-electron potential derived from density functional theory. We first discuss details on the evaluation of the various contributions to the embedding potential and provide a strategy to incorporate the use of ultrasoft pseudopotentials in a consistent fashion. The embedding potential is obtained self-consistently with respect to both the total and embedded cluster densities in the embedding region, within the framework of a frozen background density. A strategy for accomplishing this self-consistency in a numerically stable manner is presented. Finally, we demonstrate how dynamical correlation effects can be treated within this embedding framework via the multireference singles and doubles configuration interaction method. Two applications of the embedding theory are presented. The first example considers a Cu dimer embedded in the (111) surface of Cu, where we explore the effects of different models for the kinetic energy potential. We find that the embedded Cu density is reasonably well-described using simple models for the kinetic energy. The second, more challenging example involves the adsorption of Co on the (111) surface of Cu, which has been probed experimentally with scanning tunneling microscopy [H. C. Manoharan et al., Nature (London) 403, 512 (2000)]. In contrast to Kohn-Sham density functional theory, our embedding approach predicts the correct spin-compensated ground state.},

It is confirmed that Surján’s method, referred to as DM-Laplace MP2, can obtain MP2 energy accurately by means of appropriate integral quadrature and a matrix exponential evaluation scheme. Numerical tests reveal that the Euler–Maclaurin and the Romberg numerical integration schemes can achieve milli-hartree accuracy with small quadrature points. This Letter also indicates the possibility of the application of DM-Laplace MP2 to linear-scaling self-consistent field techniques, which give approximate DM.}

A new extent definition for Gaussian charge distributions is proposed, as well as a new way of dividing distributions into branches. Also, a new approach for estimating the error caused by truncation of multipole expansions is presented. It is found that the use of dynamically truncated multipole expansions gives a speedup of a factor of 10 in the work required for multipole interactions, compared to the case when all interactions are computed using a fixed multipole expansion order.

The Coulombic energy between promolecular charge densities (a sum over pairwise electrostatic energies between spherical atoms) is an excellent approximation to the missing (penetration) energy, which is often large and can dominate the exact electrostatic energy. The use of a different O⋯H repulsion–dispersion potential for ‘polar’ hydrogen atoms in some common force fields is directly related to the neglect of the O⋯H promolecule energy, suggesting that inclusion of promolecular energies be explored to improve current force fields.}

abstract = {Quantifying the density of conformations over phase space (the conformational distribution) is needed to model important macromolecular processes such as protein folding. In this work, we quantify the conformational distribution for a simple polypeptide (N-mer polyalanine) using the cumulative distribution function (CDF), which gives the probability that two randomly selected conformations are separated by less than a ``conformational'' distance and whose inverse gives conformation counts as a function of conformational radius. An important finding is that the conformation counts obtained by the CDF inverse depend critically on the assignment of a conformation's distance span and the ensemble (e.g., unfolded state model): varying ensemble and conformation definition (1 → 2 {\AA}) varies the CDF-based conformation counts for Alaso from 1011 to 10 69. In particular, relatively short molecular dynamics (MD) relaxation of Alaso's random-walk ensemble reduces the number of conformers from 1055 to 1014 (using a 1 {\AA} root-mean-square-deviation radius conformation definition) pointing to potential disconnections in comparing the results from simplified models of unfolded proteins with those from all-atom MD simulations. Explicit waters are found to roughen the landscape considerably. Under some common conformation definitions, the results herein provide (i) an upper limit to the number of accessible conformations that compose unfolded states of proteins, (ii) the optimal clustering radius/conformation radius for counting conformations for a given energy and solvent model, (iii) a means of comparing various studies, and (iv) an assessment of the applicability of random search in protein folding. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

Although the procedure is well known for closed-shell calculations and was already suggested when the Direct SCF procedure was proposed, the general procedure is less obvious. For instance, there is no need to converge the corresponding closed-shell Hartree–Fock calculation when dealing with an open-shell species. We describe the various choices and illustrate them with test calculations, showing that the procedure is easier, and on average better, than starting from a converged minimal basis calculation and much better than using a bare nucleus Hamiltonian. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the history of hybrid methods, the main differences between the various schemes, and the way they are used for the investigation of potential surfaces or properties. The chapter focuses on a hybrid method, called “ONIOM,” which can in principle use any computational method and do so for any number of layers. Most methods can only combine a quantum mechanical (QM) method with a MM method, which is generally referred to as “QM/MM.” Only several hybrid methods can also combine QM with QM or more than two different computational methods. The hybrid methods offer a solution to the scaling problem. Although the foundation for QM/MM potentials is laid much earlier, practical ways for using the surfaces needs to be developed. The number of application and post-potential methods studies is increased much relative to the attention for QM–MM interaction terms and capping methods. Judging from the continuous work, QM/MM methods will eventually impact almost every field of chemistry.}

In this paper, we investigate the cut-off behaviour of the HF exchange interaction in the DC-HF method by comparing the results of bond-alternating polyene chains with those of more delocalized uniform polyene chains. The cut-off error of the uniform chain is much larger than that of the bond-alternating chain because of the delocalized electronic structure of the uniform polyene chain. We also estimate the exponential decay coefficient of the cut-off error in the DC scheme and compare it with that of the real-space one-particle density matrix, which can be represented by the band gap in the insulator limit. It can be concluded that the cut-off derived from the DC-HF method can be reduced to an arbitrary magnitude of error by adopting an appropriate buffer radius corresponding to the band gap.},

The present study applies the DC method to such calculations including the Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange terms as the HF and hybrid HF/DFT. Reliability of the DC-HF and DC-hybrid HF/DFT is found to be strongly dependent on the cut-off radius, which defines the localization region in the DC formalism. This dependence on the cut-off radius is assessed from various points of view: that is, total energy, energy components, local energies, and density of states. Additionally, to accelerate the self-consistent field convergence in DC calculations, a new convergence technique is proposed. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem, 2007},

From the molecular Hamiltonian, using and discussing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we arrive at the Hartree and Hartree-Fock equations for the electronic problem. Special emphasis is placed on the most relevant mathematical aspects of the theoretical derivation of the final equations, and on the results regarding the existence and uniqueness of their solutions. All Hartree-Fock versions with different spin restrictions are systematically extracted from the general case, thus providing a unifying framework. The discretization of the one-electron orbital space is then reviewed and the Roothaan-Hall formalism introduced. This leads to an exposition of the basic underlying concepts related to the construction and selection of Gaussian basis sets, focusing on algorithmic efficiency issues. Finally, we close the review with a section in which the most relevant modern developments (especially those related to the design of linear-scaling methods) are commented on and linked to the issues discussed. The paper is intentionally introductory and rather self-contained, and may be useful for non-experts intending to use quantum chemical methods in interdisciplinary applications. Moreover, much material that can be found scattered in the literature has been put together to facilitate comprehension and to serve as a handy reference.},

The interactions between molecules and molecular systems play key roles in many important phenomena in chemistry, biological sciences, materials science and engineering, and chemical and mechanical engineering. An approach for studying intermolecular interactions is to employ a model potential. Such potentials, broadly referred to as “molecular mechanics” (MM), can generally not account for bond breaking but can, in principle, account for a range of intermolecular interactions. The effective fragment potential (EFP) is an accurate method for treating the broad range of intermolecular interactions, at a small fraction of the cost of ab initio calculations that produce comparable accuracy. Because no empirically fitted parameters are required, an EFP can easily be generated automatically for any closed shell species simply by running the appropriate GAMESS calculation on the isolated molecule.}

The first is a fully self-consistent treatment of the energy lowering due to polarization, which is evaluated by a self-consistent field calculation in which the molecular orbital coefficients are constrained to be block-diagonal (absolutely localized) in the interacting molecules to prohibit charge transfer.

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation methods produce trajectories of atomic positions (and optionally velocities and energies) as a function of time and provide a representation of the sampling of a given molecule's energetically accessible conformational ensemble. As simulations on the 10-100 ns time scale become routine, with sampled configurations stored on the picosecond time scale, such trajectories contain large amounts of data. Data-mining techniques, like clustering, provide one means to group and make sense of the information in the trajectory. In this work, several clustering algorithms were implemented, compared, and utilized to understand MD trajectory data. The development of the algorithms into a freely available C code library, and their application to a simple test example of random (or systematically placed) points in a 2D plane (where the pairwise metric is the distance between points) provide a means to understand the relative performance. Eleven different clustering algorithms were developed, ranging from top-down splitting (hierarchical) and bottom-up aggregating (including single-linkage edge joining, centroid-linkage, average-linkage, complete-linkage, centripetal, and centripetal-complete) to various refinement (means, Bayesian, and self-organizing maps) and tree (COBWEB) algorithms. Systematic testing in the context of MD simulation of various DNA systems (including DNA single strands and the interaction of a minor groove binding drug DB226 with a DNA hairpin) allows a more direct assessment of the relative merits of the distinct clustering algorithms. Additionally, means to assess the relative performance and differences between the algorithms, to dynamically select the initial cluster count, and to achieve faster data mining by ``sieved clustering'' were evaluated. Overall, it was found that there is no one perfect ``one size fits all'' algorithm for clustering MD trajectories and that the results strongly depend on the choice of atoms for the pairwise comparison. Some algorithms tend to produce homogeneously sized clusters, whereas others have a tendency to produce singleton clusters. Issues related to the choice of a pairwise metric, clustering metrics, which atom selection is used for the comparison, and about the relative performance are discussed. Overall, the best performance was observed with the average-linkage, means, and SOM algorithms. If the cluster count is not known in advance, the hierarchical or average-linkage clustering algorithms are recommended. Although these algorithms perform well, it is important to be aware of the limitations or weaknesses of each algorithm, specifically the high sensitivity to outliers with hierarchical, the tendency to generate homogenously sized clusters with means, and the tendency to produce small or singleton clusters with average-linkage. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Abstract Evaluation of the electrostatic energy within the effective fragment potential (EFP) method is presented. The performance of two variants of the distributed multipole analysis (DMA) together with two different models for estimating the charge penetration energies was studied using six homonuclear dimers. The importance of damping the higher order multipole terms, i.e. charge dipole, was also investigated. Damping corrections recover more than 70\% of the charge penetration energy in all dimers, whereas higher order damping introduces only minor improvement. Electrostatic energies calculated by the numerical DMA are less accurate than those calculated by the analytic DMA. Analysis of bonding in the benzene dimer shows that EFP with inclusion of the electrostatic damping term performs very well compared to the high-level coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples method. The largest error of 0.4 kcal/mol occurs for the sandwich dimer configuration. This error is about half the size of the corresponding error in second order perturbation theory. Thus, EFP in the current implementation is an accurate and computationally inexpensive method for calculating interaction energies in weakly bonded molecular complexes. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For specially constructed pairs of electron densities, for which the analytic expression for the differences of T-s[rho] is known, it is shown that the accuracy of the quantities derivable from a given approximation to T-s[rho]: energy differences and their functional derivatives, does not reflect that of T-s[rho] itself. The comparisons between the exact values of the kinetic energy in such cases are proposed as an independent condition/criterion for appraisal of approximations to T-s[rho].},

abstract = {Abstract We present a simple damping scheme for point-charge electrostatics that could be used directly in classical force fields. The approach acts at the charge (or monopole) level only and allows the inclusion of short-range electrostatic penetration effects at a very low cost. Results are compared with density functional theory Coulomb intermolecular interaction energies and with several other methods such as distributed multipoles, damped distributed multipoles, and transferable Hermite-Gaussian densities. Realistic trends in the interactions are observed for atom-centered Mertz-Kollman corrected point-charge distributions. The approach allows increasing the selectivity of parameters in the case of metal complexes. In addition, two QM/MM calculations are presented where the damping function is employed to include the MM atoms located at the QM/MM boundary. The first calculation corresponds to the gas-phase proton transfer of aspartic acid through water and the second is the first step of the reaction catalyzed by the 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4OT) enzyme. First, improved agreement is observed when using the damping approach compared with the conventional excluded charge method or when including all charges in the calculation. Second, in the case of 4OT, the damped charge approach is in agreement with previous calculations, whereas including all charges gives a significantly higher energy barrier. In both cases, no reparameterization of the van der Waals part of the force field was performed. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2008},

abstract = {We present a simple and efficient embedding scheme for the wave-function based calculation of the energies of local excitations in large systems. By introducing an embedding potential obtained from density-functional theory (DFT) it is possible to describe the effect of an environment on local excitations of an embedded system in wave-function theory (WFT) calculations of the excitation energies. We outline the implementation of such a WFT-in-DFT embedding procedure employing the ADF, Dalton and DIRAC codes, where the embedded subsystem is treated with coupled cluster methods. We then evaluate this procedure in the calculation of the solvatochromic shift of acetone in water and of the f-f spectrum of NpO22+ embedded in a Cs2UO2Cl4 crystal and find that our scheme does effectively incorporate the environment effect in both cases. A particularly interesting finding is that with our embedding scheme we can model the equatorial Cl- ligands in NpO2Cl42- quite accurately, compared to a fully wavefunction-based calculation, and this opens up the possibility of modeling the interaction of different ligands to actinyl species with relatively high accuracy but at a much reduced computational cost.},

As a result, the properties depending on the quality of this potential are invariably improved compared to the ones obtained using conventional approximants which violated the considered exact condition. The approximants obtained following the proposed strategy and especially the simplest one constructed in this work are nondecomposable, i.e., cannot be used to obtain the analytic expression for the functional of the total kinetic energy.},

This novel chiral cup-shaped molecule was isolated in racemic form and in excellent yield after the addition of methyl lithium to the BF 4 salt of a novel unsymmetrical diazaoxatriangulenium cation. Compound 6a was found to be stable under classical laboratory conditions-something not obvious considering the extreme stability of the carbenium ion precursor, the electron-rich nature of the core, and the strain induced by the pyramidalization of the central carbon. The enantiomers were readily separated by chiral stationary phase chromatography, and the absolute configuration of (-)-( S)- 6a was determined by a comparison of the experimental and theoretical vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra. This isolation of (-)-( S)- 6a and (+)-( R)- 6a constitutes thus the first report of a nonracemic closed-capped chiral bowl molecule for which the chirality is due to the intrinsic dissymmetry of the central core of the structure only.},

The implementation of a McMurchie-Davidson scheme for the calculation of the molecular integrals over London orbitals is discussed, and preliminary applications of the newly developed code to the calculation of fourth-rank hypermagnetizabilities for a set of small molecules, benzene, and cyclobutadiene are presented. The nonperturbative approach is particularly useful for studying the highly nonlinear response of paramagnetic closed-shell systems such as boron monohydride, or the $\pi$ -electron response of cyclobutadiene. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A Laplace-transformed second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) method is presented, which allows to achieve linear scaling of the computational effort with molecular size for electronically local structures. Also for systems with a delocalized electronic structure, a cubic or even quadratic scaling behavior is achieved. Numerically significant contributions to the atomic orbital (AO)-MP2 energy are preselected using the so-called multipole-based integral estimates (MBIE) introduced earlier by us [The Journal of Chemical Physics 123, 184102 (2005)]. Since MBIE provides rigorous upper bounds, numerical accuracy is fully controlled and the exact MP2 result is attained. While the choice of thresholds for a specific accuracy is only weakly dependent upon the molecular system, our AO-MP2 scheme offers the possibility for incremental thresholding: for only little additional computational expense, the numerical accuracy can be systematically converged. We illustrate this dependence upon numerical thresholds for the calculation of intermolecular interaction energies for the S22 test set. The efficiency and accuracy of our AO-MP2 method is demonstrated for linear alkanes, stacked DNA base pairs, and carbon nanotubes: e.g., for DNA systems the crossover toward conventional MP2 schemes occurs between one and two base pairs. In this way, it is for the first time possible to compute wave function-based correlation energies for systems containing more than 1000 atoms with 10 000 basis functions as illustrated for a 16 base pair DNA system on a single-core computer, where no empirical restrictions are introduced and numerical accuracy is fully preserved. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Three exciting new methods that address the accurate prediction of processes and properties of large molecular systems are discussed. The systematic fragmentation method (SFM) and the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method both decompose a large molecular system (e.g., protein, liquid, zeolite) into small subunits (fragments) in very different ways that are designed to both retain the high accuracy of the chosen quantum mechanical level of theory while greatly reducing the demands on computational time and resources. Each of these methods is inherently scalable and is therefore eminently capable of taking advantage of massively parallel computer hardware while retaining the accuracy of the corresponding electronic structure method from which it is derived. The effective fragment potential (EFP) method is a sophisticated approach for the prediction of nonbonded and intermolecular interactions. Therefore, the EFP method provides a way to further reduce the computational effort while retaining accuracy by treating the far-field interactions in place of the full electronic structure method. The performance of the methods is demonstrated using applications to several systems, including benzene dimer, small organic species, pieces of the R helix, water, and ionic liquids. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Abstract A dual-level hierarchical scheme for the linear-scaling divide-and-conquer (DC)-based correlation theory is presented as a combination of dual-buffer and dual-basis approaches. Although the dual-basis approach has been well developed, the dual-buffer approach is specific for the DC correlation method and based on the different interaction lengths between the Hartree–Fock and correlation methods. This study performs numerical assessments of the dual-buffer DC-MP2 (second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation) systematically. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2009},

abstract = {A production level implementation of the closed-shell local quadratic configuration interaction and coupled cluster methods with single and double excitations (QCISD and CCSD) based on the concept of pair natural orbitals [local pair natural orbital LPNO-QCISD and LPNO-CCSD) is reported, evaluated, and discussed. This work is an extension of the earlier developed LPNO coupled-electron pair approximation (LNPO-CEPA) method [F. Neese et al., Chem. Phys. 130, 114108 (2009)] and makes extended use of the resolution of the identity (RI) or density fitting (DF) approximation. Two variants of each method are compared. The less accurate approximations (LPNO2-QCISD/LPNO2-CCSD) still recover 98.7%-99.3% of the correlation energy in the given basis and have modest disk space requirements. The more accurate variants (LPNO1-QCISD/LPNO1-CCSD) typically recover 99.75%-99.95% of the correlation energy in the given basis but require the Coulomb and exchange operators with up to two-external indices to be stored on disk. Both variants have comparable computational efficiency. The convergence of the results with respect to the natural orbital truncation parameter (T(CutPNO)) has been studied. Extended numerical tests have been performed on absolute and relative correlation energies as function of basis set size and T(CutPNO) as well as on reaction energies, isomerization energies, and weak intermolecular interactions. The results indicate that the errors of the LPNO methods compared to the canonical QCISD and CCSD methods are below 1 kcal/mol with our default thresholds. Finally, some calculations on larger molecules are reported (ranging from 40-86 atoms) and it is shown that for medium sized molecules the total wall clock time required to complete the LPNO-CCSD calculations is only two to four times that of the preceding self-consistent field (SCF). Thus these methods are highly suitable for large-scale computational chemistry applications. Since there are only three thresholds involved that have been given conservative default values, the methods can be confidentially used in a "black-box" fashion in the same way as their canonical counterparts.},

abstract = {This work presents the implementation and analysis of several damping functions for Coulomb, induction, and dispersion interactions within the framework of the general effective fragment potential (EFP) method. Damping is necessary to obtain the correct asymptotic short-range behavior of these interactions. Correctly chosen damping functions allow a balanced description of different parts of intermolecular potential energy surfaces and improve the accuracy of predicted intermolecular distances and binding energies. The performance of different damping functions is tested by comparing the EFP energy terms with the symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) energy terms in a range of intermolecular separations for ten molecular dimers. The total EFP binding energies in these dimers were compared with the binding energies obtained from SAPT and coupled cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)]. A formula for electrostatic damping that was derived from first principles is recommended. This method employs the overlap of fragment localized molecular orbitals (LMO) within the spherical Gaussian approximation. The LMO overlap integrals are also used to determine the damping of dispersion. Gaussian polarization damping functions are recommended for use within the EFP framework. With this set of damping functions, the EFP binding energies are within 0.5 kcal/mol and intermolecular equilibrium separations are within 0.2 of the corresponding CCSD(T) and SAPT values. This consistent accuracy of EFP is encouraging for future studies of more complicated molecular complexes.},

abstract = {We describe an embedded density functional theory (DFT) protocol in which the nonadditive kinetic energy component of the embedding potential is treated exactly. At each iteration of the Kohn-Sham equations for constrained electron density, the Zhao-Morrison-Parr constrained search method for constructing Kohn-Sham orbitals is combined with the King-Handy expression for the exact kinetic potential. We use this formally exact embedding protocol to calculate ionization energies for a series of three- and four-electron atomic systems, and the results are compared to embedded DFT calculations that utilize the Thomas-Fermi (TF) and the Thomas-Fermi-von Weisacker approximations to the kinetic energy functional. These calculations illustrate the expected breakdown due to the TF approximation for the nonadditive kinetic potential, with errors of 30{\%}-80{\%} in the calculated ionization energies; by contrast, the exact protocol is found to be accurate and stable. To significantly improve the convergence of the new protocol, we introduce a density-based switching function to map between the exact nonadditive kinetic potential and the TF approximation in the region of the nuclear cusp, and we demonstrate that this approximation has little effect on the accuracy of the calculated ionization energies. Finally, we describe possible extensions of the exact protocol to perform accurate embedded DFT calculations in large systems with strongly overlapping subsystem densities.},

Without further approximations, the DFT-in-DFT embedding approach results in a pair of coupled Euler-Lagrange equations. In contrast to DFT-in-DFT, the WFT-in-DFT approach is shown to ensure a systematic description of excited states if such states are mainly related to excitations within the embedded subsystem. Possible ways for the practical realization of the WFT-in-DFT approach for studying excited states are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {We report here the results for an ab initio approach to obtain the parameters needed for molecular simulations using a polarizable force field. These parameters consist of the atomic charges, polarizabilities, and radii. The former two are readily obtained using methods reported previously (van Duijnen and Swart, J Phys Chem A 1998, 102, 2399; Swart et al. J Comput Chem 2001, 22, 79), whereas here we report a new approach for obtaining atomic second-order radii (SOR), which is based on second-order atomic moments in scaled Voronoi cells. These parameters are obtained from quantum- chemistry calculations on the monomers, and used without further adaptation directly for intermolecular interactions. The approach works very well as shown here for four dimers, where high-level coupled cluster with singles and doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) and density functional theory (DFT) Swart-Sola `-Bickelhaupt functional including Grimme's dispersion correction (SSB-D) reference data are available for comparison. The energy surfaces for the three methods are very similar, which is also the case for the interaction between a water molecule with either a chloride anion or a sodium cation. These latter systems had previously been used to criticize Thole's damped point-dipole method, but here we show that with the correct use of the method, it is perfectly able to describe the intermolecular interactions. This is most obvious for the induced dipole moment as function of the chloride-oxygen distance, where the direct (discrete) reaction field results are virtually indistinguishable from those obtained at CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ.},

abstract = {Molecular force fields have been approaching a generational transition over the past several years, moving away from well-established and well-tuned, but intrinsically limited, fixed point charge models toward more intricate and expensive polarizable models that should allow more accurate description of molecular properties. The recently introduced AMOEBA force field is a leading publicly available example of this next generation of theoretical model, but to date, it has only received relatively limited validation, which we address here. We show that the AMOEBA force field is in fact a significant improvement over fixed charge models for small molecule structural and thermodynamic observables in particular, although further fine-tuning is necessary to describe solvation free energies of drug-like small molecules, dynamical properties away from ambient conditions, and possible improvements in aromatic interactions. State of the art electronic structure calculations reveal generally very good agreement with AMOEBA for demanding problems such as relative conformational energies of the alanine tetrapeptide and isomers of water sulfate complexes. AMOEBA is shown to be especially successful on protein-ligand binding and computational X-ray crystallography where polarization and accurate electrostatics are critical. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {A hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method for the electronic excited states has been developed. The equation-of-motion coupled cluster with single and double excitations method (EOM-CCSD) is used for the QM region, while the effective fragment potential (EFP) method describes a MM part. The EFP method overcomes the most significant limitation of QM/MM by replacing empirical MM interactions and QM/MM coupling by parameter-free first-principles-based ones, while retaining the computational efficiency of QM/MM. The developed QM/MM scheme involves quantum-mechanical coupling of the electrostatic and polarization terms in the QM/MM Hamiltonian and allows accurate calculation of the electronic excited states of chromophores in various environments. Applications to the water complexes of formaldehyde and p-nitroaniline show that the orbital relaxation of the solute in the electric field of the solvent provides the majority of the solvatochromic effect, and the response of the polarizable environment to the density of the specific electronic state is much smaller in magnitude.},

abstract = {The bi-functional for the non-electrostatic part of the exact embedding potential of frozen-density embedding theory (FDET) depends on whether the embedded part is described by means of a real interacting many-electron system or the reference system of non-interacting electrons (see [Wesolowski, Phys. Rev. A. 77, 11444 (2008)]). The difference $\delta$$\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)]/$\delta$$\rho$(A)(r{\textless}combining arrow{\textgreater}), where $\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)] is the functional bound from below by the correlation functional E(c)[$\rho$(A)] and from above by zero. Taking into account $\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)] in both the embedding potential and in energy is indispensable for assuring that all calculated quantities are self-consistent and that FDET leads to the exact energy and density in the limit of exact functionals. Since not much is known about good approximations for $\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)], we examine numerically the adequacy of neglecting $\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)] entirely. To this end, we analyze the significance of $\delta$$\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)]/$\delta$$\rho$(A)(r{\textless}combining arrow{\textgreater}) in the case where the magnitude of $\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)] is the largest, i.e., for Hartree-Fock wavefunction. In hydrogen bonded model systems, neglecting $\delta$$\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)]/$\delta$$\rho$(A)(r{\textless}combining arrow{\textgreater}) in the embedding potential marginally affects the total energy (less than 5{\%} change in the interaction energy) but results in qualitative changes in the calculated hydrogen-bonding induced shifts of the orbital energies. Based on this estimation, we conclude that neglecting $\delta$$\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)]/$\delta$$\rho$(A)(r{\textless}combining arrow{\textgreater}) may represent a good approximation for multi-reference variational methods using adequate choice for the active space. Doing the same for single-reference perturbative methods is not recommended. Not only it leads to violation of self-consistency but might result in large effect on orbital energies. It is shown also that the errors in total energy due to neglecting $\delta$$\Delta$F(MD)[$\rho$(A)]/$\delta$$\rho$(A)(r{\textless}combining arrow{\textgreater}) do not cancel but rather add up to the errors due to approximation for the bi-functional of the non-additive kinetic potential.},

abstract = {The development of M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MPPT) has seen four different periods in almost 80 years. In the first 40 years (period 1), MPPT was largely ignored because the focus of quantum chemists was on variational methods. After the development of many-body perturbation theory by theoretical physicists in the 1950s and 1960s, a second 20-year long period started, during which MPn methods up to order n = 6 were developed and computer-programed. In the late 1980s and in the 1990s (period 3), shortcomings of MPPT became obvious, especially the sometimes erratic or even divergent behavior of the MPn series. The physical usefulness of MPPT was questioned and it was suggested to abandon the theory. Since the 1990s (period 4), the focus of method development work has been almost exclusively on MP2. A wealth of techniques and approaches has been put forward to convert MP2 from a O(M5) computational problem into a low-order or linear-scaling task that can handle molecules with thousands of atoms. In addition, the accuracy of MP2 has been systematically improved by introducing spin scaling, dispersion corrections, orbital optimization, or explicit correlation. The coming years will see a continuously strong development in MPPT that will have an essential impact on other quantum chemical methods. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The effects of solvents on electronic spectra can be treated efficiently by combining an accurate quantum mechanical (QM) method for the solute with an efficient and accurate method for the solvent molecules. One of the most sophisticated approaches for treating solvent effects is the effective fragment potential (EFP) method. The EFP method has been interfaced with several QM methods, including configuration interaction, time-dependent density functional theory, multiconfigurational methods, and equations-of-motion coupled cluster methods. These combined QM-EFP methods provide a range of efficient and accurate methods for studying the impact of solvents on electronic excited states. An energy decomposition analysis in terms of physically meaningful components is presented in order to analyze these solvent effects. Several factors that must be considered when one investigates solvent effects on electronic spectra are discussed, and several examples are presented.},

abstract = {The ASEP-MD method has been employed for studying the solvent effect on the conformational equilibrium of the alanine dipeptide in water solution. MP2 and density functional theory (DFT) levels of theory were used and results were compared. While in gas phase cyclic structures showing intramolecular hydrogen bonds were found to be the most stable, the stability order is reversed in water solution. Intermolecular interaction with the solvent causes the predominance of extended structures as the stabilizing contacts dipeptide-water are favoured. Free-energy differences in solution were calculated and PPII, R, and C5 conformers were identified as the most stable at MP2 level. Experimental data from Raman and IR techniques show discrepancies about the relative abundance of R y C5, our results support the Raman data. The DFT level of theory agrees with MP2 in the location and stability of PPII and R forms but fails in the location of C5. MP2 results suggest the possibility of finding traces of C7eq conformer in water solution, in agreement with recent experiments. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.},

abstract = {We present the theory and an implementation of the combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics/polarizable dielectric continuum (QM/MM/PCM) method. This is a fully polarizable layered model designed for effective inclusion of a medium in a quantum-mechanical calculation. The short-range part of the solvent electrostatic potential is described by an atomistic model while the long-range part of this potential is described by a dielectric continuum. The QM/MM/PCM method has been implemented in combination with QM linear response techniques allowing for the assessment of, e.g., vertical electronic excitation energies and linear dipole-dipole polarizabilities, in all cases using a nonequilibrium formulation of the environmental response. The model is general, but is here implemented for the case of density functional theory. Numerical examples are given for solvatochromic shifts relating to a set of organic molecules in aqueous solution. We find in general the QM/MM/PCM interface to exhibit a faster convergence with respect to the system size as compared to the use of QM/MM only.},

abstract = {The ONIOM (our Own N-layer Integrated molecular Orbital molecular Mechanics) method is one of the most popular, successful, and easily-to-implement hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods to treat complex molecular systems. Hybrid QM/MM methods take advantage of the high accuracy of QM methods and the low computational cost of MM methods. One key feature of the ONIOM method is a simple linear extrapolation procedure, which allows the ONIOM method to be further extended to two-layer ONIOM(QM1:QM2), three-layer ONIOM(QM1:QM2:MM), and, in principle, any n-layer n-level-of-theory methods. Such hierarchical features of the ONIOM method are unique among the hybrid QM/MM methods. This review article provides an overview of the theoretical foundation and recent development of the ONIOM method. Some of its recent applications to metalloenzymes and photobiology will also be highlighted. Prospective ONIOM development for more realistic simulations on the complex systems will be discussed finally. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Herbert2012,
abstract = {A method that we have recently introduced for rapid computation of intermolecular interaction energies is reformulated and subjected to further tests. The method employs monomer-based self-consistent field calculations with an electrostatic embedding designed to capture many-body polarization (the ``XPol'' procedure), augmented by pairwise symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) to capture dispersion and exchange interactions along with any remaining induction effects. A rigorous derivation of the XPol+SAPT methodology is presented here, which demonstrates that the method is systematically improvable, and moreover introduces some additional intermolecular interactions as compared to the more heuristic derivation that was presented previously. Applications to various non-covalent complexes and clusters are presented, including geometry optimizations and one-dimensional potential energy scans. The performance of the XPol+SAPT methodology in its present form (based on second-order intermolecular perturbation theory and neglecting intramolecular electron correlation) is qualitatively acceptable across a wide variety of systems-and quantitatively quite good in certain cases-but the quality of the results is rather sensitive to the choice of one-particle basis set. Basis sets that work well for dispersion-bound systems offer less-than-optimal performance for clusters dominated by induction and electrostatic interactions, and vice versa. A compromise basis set is identified that affords good results for both induction and dispersion interactions, although this favorable performance ultimately relies on error cancellation, as in traditional low-order SAPT. Suggestions for future improvements to the methodology are discussed.},

@article{Martinez2012,
abstract = {It has become common to reference ``pi-stacking'' forces or ``pi-pi interactions'' when describing the interactions between neighbouring aromatic rings. Here, we review experimental and theoretical literature across several fields and conclude that the terms ``pi-stacking'' and ``pi-pi interactions'' do not accurately describe the forces that drive association between aromatic molecules of the types most commonly studied in chemistry or biology laboratories. We therefore propose that these terms are misleading and should no longer be used. Even without these terms, electrostatic considerations relating to polarized pi systems, as described by Hunter and Sanders, have provided a good qualitative starting place for predicting and understanding the interactions between aromatics for almost two decades. More recent work, however, is revealing that direct electrostatic interactions between polarized atoms of substituents as well as solvation/desolvation effects in strongly interacting solvents must also be considered and even dominate in many circumstances.},

@article{Maurer2012,
abstract = {A new integral estimate for four-center two-electron integrals is introduced that accounts for distance information between the bra- and ket-charge distributions describing the two electrons. The screening is denoted as QQR and combines the most important features of the conventional Schwarz screening by H{\"{a}}ser and Ahlrichs published in 1989 [Journal of Computational Chemistry 10, 104 (1989)] and our multipole-based integral estimates (MBIE) introduced in 2005 [D. S. Lambrecht and C. Ochsenfeld, The Journal of Chemical Physics 123, 184101 (2005)]. At the same time the estimates are not only tighter but also much easier to implement, so that we recommend them instead of our MBIE bounds introduced first for accounting for charge-distance information. The inclusion of distance dependence between charge distributions is not only useful at the SCF level but is particularly important for describing electron-correlation effects, e.g., within AO-MP2 theory, where the decay behavior is at least 1/R 4 or even 1/R 6. In our present work, we focus on studying the efficiency of our QQR estimates within SCF theory and demonstrate the performance for a benchmark set of 44 medium to large molecules, where savings of up to a factor of 2 for exchange integrals are observed for larger systems. Based on the results of the benchmark set we show that reliable tightness of integral estimates is more important for the screening performance than rigorous upper bound properties. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A procedure for a detailed analysis of excited states in systems of interacting chromophores is proposed. By considering the one-electron transition density matrix, a wealth of information is recovered that may be missed by manually analyzing the wave function. Not only are the position and spatial extent given, but insight into the intrinsic structure of the exciton is readily obtained as well. For example, the method can differentiate between excitonic and charge resonance interactions even in completely symmetric systems. Four examples are considered to highlight the utility of the approach: interactions between the n$\pi$* states in a formaldehyde dimer, excimer formation in the naphthalene dimer, stacking interaction in an adenine dimer, and the excitonic band structure in a conjugated phenylenevinylene oligomer.},

@article{Shi2013,
abstract = {Development of the AMOEBA (atomic multipole optimized energetics for biomolecular simulation) force field for proteins is presented. The current version (AMOEBA-2013) utilizes permanent electrostatic multipole moments through the quadrupole at each atom, and explicitly treats polarization effects in various chemical and physical environments. The atomic multipole electrostatic parameters for each amino acid residue type are derived from high-level gas phase quantum mechanical calculations via a consistent and extensible protocol. Molecular polarizability is modeled via a Thole-style damped interactive induction model based upon distributed atomic polarizabilities. Inter- and intramolecular polarization is treated in a consistent fashion via the Thole model. The intramolecular polarization model ensures transferability of electrostatic parameters among different conformations, as demonstrated by the agreement between QM and AMOEBA electrostatic potentials, and dipole moments of dipeptides. The backbone and side chain torsional parameters were determined by comparing to gas-phase QM (RI-TRIM MP2/CBS) conformational energies of dipeptides and to statistical distributions from the Protein Data Bank. Molecular dynamics simulations are reported for short peptides in explicit water to examine their conformational properties in solution. Overall the calculated conformational free energies and J-coupling constants are consistent with PDB statistics and experimental NMR results, respectively. In addition, the experimental crystal structures of a number of proteins are well maintained during molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. While further calculations are necessary to fully validate the force field, initial results suggest the AMOEBA polarizable multipole force field is able to describe the structure and energetics of peptides and proteins, in both gas-phase and solution environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

The results for the calculated absorption and emission transitions are found in good agreement with experiment both in gas phase and in water. The solvent effect on the Stokes shift is also calculated in good agreement with experiment.

We study methylenecyclopropene and acrolein in water by using several wavefunction approaches to validate the supermolecular reference and to assess their response to embedding. We find that quantum Monte Carlo, complete-active space second-order perturbation theory, and coupled cluster methods give very consistent solvatochromic shifts and a similar response to embedding. Our scheme corrects the excitation energies produced with a frozen environment, but the values are often overshot. To ameliorate the problem, one needs to use wavefunction densities to polarize the environment. The choice of the exchange-correlation functional in the construction of the potential has little effect on the excitation, whereas the approximate kinetic-energy functional appears to be the largest source of error.},

abstract = {The recently developed X-ray constrained extremely localized molecular orbital (XC-ELMO) technique is a potentially useful tool for the determination and analysis of experimental electron densities. Molecular orbitals strictly localized on atoms, bonds or functional groups allow one to combine the quantum-mechanical rigour of the wavefunction-based approaches with the easy chemical interpretability typical of the traditional multipole models. In this paper, using very high quality X-ray diffraction data for the glycylglycine crystal, a detailed assessment of the capabilities and limitations of this new method is given. In particular, the effects of constraining the ELMO wavefunctions to experimental X-ray structure-factor amplitudes and the ability of the method to reproduce benchmark electron distributions have been accurately investigated. Topological analysis of the XC-ELMO electron densities and of the zero-flux surface-integrated charges and dipole moments shows that the new strategy is already reliable, provided that sufficiently flexible basis sets are used. These analyses also raise new questions and call for further improvements of the method.},

@article{Li2014,
abstract = {ConspectusLocalized molecular orbitals (LMO) not only serve as an important bridge between chemical intuition and molecular wave functions but also can be employed to reduce the computational cost of many-body methods for electron correlation and excitation. Therefore, how to localize the usually completely delocalized canonical molecular orbitals (CMO) into confined physical spaces has long been an important topic: It has a long history but still remains active to date.While the known LMOs can be classified into (exact) orthonormal and nonorthogonal, as well as (approximate) absolutely localized MOs, the ways for achieving these can be classified into two categories, a posteriori top-down and a priori bottom-up, depending on whether they invoke the global CMOs (or equivalently the molecular density matrix). While the top-down approaches have to face heavy tasks of minimizing or maximizing a given localization functional typically of many adjacent local extrema, the bottom-up ones have to invoke some tedious procedures for first generating a local basis composed of well-defined occupied and unoccupied subsets and then maintaining or resuming the locality when solving the Hartree-Fock/Kohn-Sham (HF/KS) optimization condition.It is shown here that the good of these kinds of approaches can be combined together to form a very efficient hybrid approach that can generate the desired LMOs for any kind of gapped molecules. Specifically, a top-down localization functional, applied to individual small subsystems only, is minimized to generate an orthonormal local basis composed of functions centered on the preset chemical fragments. The familiar notion for atomic cores, lone pairs, and chemical bonds emerges here automatically. Such a local basis is then employed in the global HF/KS calculation, after which a least action is taken toward the final orthonormal localized molecular orbitals (LMO), both occupied and virtual. This last step is very cheap, implying that, after the CMOs, the LMOs can be obtained essentially for free. Because molecular fragments are taken as the basic elements, the approach is in the spirit of "from fragments to molecule". Two representatives of highly conjugated molecules, that is, C12H2 and C60, are taken as showcases for demonstrating the success of the proposed approach. The use of the so-obtained LMOs will lead naturally to low-order scaling post-HF/KS methods for electron correlation or excitation. In addition, the underlying fragment picture allows for easy and pictorial interpretations of the correlation/excitation dynamics.},

In this model, the solvent is represented as a non-uniform continuum taking into account both the statistical nature of the solvent and specific solute-solvent interactions. It offers, therefore, a computationally attractive alternative to methods in which the solvent is described at atomistic level. The evaluation of the solvatochromic shift involves only two calculations of excitation energy instead of at least hundreds needed to account for inhomogeneous broadening. The present review provides a detailed graphical analysis of the key quantities of this model: the average charge density of the solvent (〈$\rho$B〉) and the corresponding Frozen-Density Embedding Theory derived embedding potential for coumarin 153.},

abstract = {We present a novel implementation of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory utilizing London atomic orbitals as basis functions. External magnetic fields are treated non-perturbatively, which enable the study of both magnetic response properties and the effects of strong fields, using either standard density functionals or current-density functionals - the implementation is the first fully self-consistent implementation of the latter for molecules. Pilot applications are presented for the finite-field calculation of molecular magnetizabilities, hypermagnetizabilities, and nuclear magnetic resonance shielding constants, focusing on the impact of current-density functionals on the accuracy of the results. Existing current-density functionals based on the gauge-invariant vorticity are tested and found to be sensitive to numerical details of their implementation. Furthermore, when appropriately regularized, the resulting magnetic properties show no improvement over standard density-functional results. An advantage of the present implementation is the ability to apply density-functional theory to molecules in very strong magnetic fields, where the perturbative approach breaks down. Comparison with high accuracy full-configuration-interaction results show that the inadequacies of current-density approximations are exacerbated with increasing magnetic field strength. Standard density-functionals remain well behaved but fail to deliver high accuracy. The need for improved current-dependent density-functionals, and how they may be tested using the presented implementation, is discussed in light of our findings. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {Frozen-Density-Embedding Theory (FDET) is a formalism to obtain the upper bound of the ground-state energy of the total system and the corresponding embedded wavefunction by means of Euler-Lagrange equations [T. A. Wesolowski, Phys. Rev. A 77(1), 012504 (2008)]. FDET provides the expression for the embedding potential as a functional of the electron density of the embedded species, electron density of the environment, and the field generated by other charges in the environment. Under certain conditions, FDET leads to the exact ground-state energy and density of the whole system. Following Perdew-Levy theorem on stationary states of the ground-state energy functional, the other-than-ground-state stationary states of the FDET energy functional correspond to excited states. In the present work, we analyze such use of other-than-ground-state embedded wavefunctions obtained in practical calculations, i.e., when the FDET embedding potential is approximated. Three computational approaches based on FDET, that assure self-consistent excitation energy and embedded wavefunction dealing with the issue of orthogonality of embedded wavefunctions for different states in a different manner, are proposed and discussed.},

abstract = {Frozen density embedding (FDE) has become a popular subsystem density functional theory (DFT) method for systems with weakly overlapping charge densities. The failure of this method for strongly interacting and covalent systems is due to the approximate kinetic energy density functional (KEDF), although the need for approximate KEDFs may be eliminated if each subsystem's Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals are orthogonal to the other, termed external orthogonality (EO). We present an implementation of EO into the FDE framework within the Amsterdam density functional program package, using the level-shift projection operator method. We generalize this method to remove the need for orbital localization schemes and to include multiple subsystems, and we show that the exact KS-DFT energies and densities may be reproduced through iterative freeze-and-thaw cycles for a number of systems, including a charge delocalized benzene molecule starting from atomic subsystems. Finally, we examine the possibility of a truncated basis for systems with and without charge delocalization, and found that subsystems require a basis that allows them to correctly describe the supermolecular delocalized orbitals.},

To identify which theoretical framework of the chromophore--protein complex can realistically capture its essence, we employ here a variety of electronic-structure methods, namely, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), multireference perturbation theory (NEVPT2 and CASPT2), and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) in combination with static point charges (QM/MM), DFT embedding (QM/DFT), and classical polarizable embedding through induced dipoles (QM/MMpol). Since structural modifications can significantly affect the photophysics of GFP, we also account for thermal fluctuations through extensive molecular dynamics simulations.

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of protein receptors have become an attractive tool for rational drug discovery. However, the high computational cost of employing molecular dynamics trajectories in virtual screening of large repositories threats the feasibility of this task. Computational intelligence techniques have been applied in this context, with the ultimate goal of reducing the overall computational cost so the task can become feasible. Particularly, clustering algorithms have been widely used as a means to reduce the dimensionality of molecular dynamics trajectories. In this paper, we develop a novel methodology for clustering entire trajectories using structural features from the substrate-binding cavity of the receptor in order to optimize docking experiments on a cloud-based environment. The resulting partition was selected based on three clustering validity criteria, and it was further validated by analyzing the interactions between 20 ligands and a fully flexible receptor (FFR) model containing a 20 ns molecular dynamics simulation trajectory. Our proposed methodology shows that taking into account features of the substrate-binding cavity as input for the k-means algorithm is a promising technique for accurately selecting ensembles of representative structures tailored to a specific ligand.},

In this topical review, we focus on some recent advances in this field related to the computation of condensed phase systems, their excited states, and the evaluation of many-body interactions between the subsystems. As subsystem DFT is in principle an exact theory, any advance in this field can have a dual role. One is the possible applicability of a resulting method in practical calculations. The other is the possibility of shedding light on some quantum-mechanical phenomenon which is more easily treated by subdividing a supersystem into subsystems. An example of the latter is many-body interactions. In the discussion, we present some recent work from our research group as well as some new results, casting them in the current state-of-the-art in this review as comprehensively as possible.},

The design of the algorithms is independent of the studied property, the used level of theory, as well as of the role of the optimized basis set: the procedure can be used to form auxiliary basis sets in a similar fashion. This implementation can easily be interfaced with various computer programs for the actual calculation of molecular properties for the optimization, and the calculations can be trivially parallelized. Routines for general and segmented contraction of the generated basis sets are also included. The algorithms are demonstrated for two properties of the argon atom - the total energy and the nuclear magnetic shielding constant - and they will be used in upcoming work for generation of cost-efficient basis sets for various properties.},

The Amber ff99SB force field improved protein secondary structure balance and dynamics from earlier force fields like ff99, but weaknesses in side chain rotamer and backbone secondary structure preferences have been identified. Here, we performed a complete refit of all amino acid side chain dihedral parameters, which had been carried over from ff94. The training set of conformations included multidimensional dihedral scans designed to improve transferability of the parameters. Improvement in all amino acids was obtained as compared to ff99SB. Parameters were also generated for alternate protonation states of ionizable side chains. Average errors in relative energies of pairs of conformations were under 1.0 kcal/mol as compared to QM, reduced 35% from ff99SB. We also took the opportunity to make empirical adjustments to the protein backbone dihedral parameters as compared to ff99SB. Multiple small adjustments of $\phi$ and $\psi$ parameters were tested against NMR scalar coupling data and secondary structure content for short peptides. The best results were obtained from a physically motivated adjustment to the $\phi$ rotational profile that compensates for lack of ff99SB QM training data in the $\beta$-ppII transition region. Together, these backbone and side chain modifications (hereafter called ff14SB) not only better reproduced their benchmarks, but also improved secondary structure content in small peptides and reproduction of NMR $\chi$1 scalar coupling measurements for proteins in solution. We also discuss the Amber ff12SB parameter set, a preliminary version of ff14SB that includes most of its improvements.},

We denote this new approach the polarizable density embedding (PDE) model, and it represents an extension of our previously developed polarizable embedding (PE) strategy. The PDE model is a focused computational approach in which a core region of the system studied is represented by a quantum-chemical method, whereas the environment is divided into two other regions: an inner and an outer region. Molecules belonging to the inner region are described by their exact densities, whereas molecules in the outer region are treated using a multipole expansion. In addition, all molecules in the environment are assigned distributed polarizabilities in order to account for induction effects. The joint effects of the inner and outer regions on the quantum-mechanical core part of the system is formulated using an embedding potential. The PDE model is illustrated for a set of dimers (interaction energy calculations) as well as for the calculation of electronic excitation energies, showing promising results.},

@article{Pinski2015,
abstract = {In this work, a systematic infrastructure is described that formalizes concepts implicit in previous work and greatly simplifies computer implementation of reduced-scaling electronic structure methods. The key concept is sparse representation of tensors using chains of sparse maps between two index sets. Sparse map representation can be viewed as a generalization of compressed sparse row, a common representation of a sparse matrix, to tensor data. By combining few elementary operations on sparse maps (inversion, chaining, intersection, etc.), complex algorithms can be developed, illustrated here by a linear-scaling transformation of three-center Coulomb integrals based on our compact code library that implements sparse maps and operations on them. The sparsity of the three-center integrals arises from spatial locality of the basis functions and domain density fitting approximation. A novel feature of our approach is the use of differential overlap integrals computed in linear-scaling fashion for screening products of basis functions. Finally, a robust linear scaling domain based local pair natural orbital second-order M{\"{o}}ller-Plesset (DLPNO-MP2) method is described based on the sparse map infrastructure that only depends on a minimal number of cutoff parameters that can be systematically tightened to approach 100% of the canonical MP2 correlation energy. With default truncation thresholds, DLPNO-MP2 recovers more than 99.9% of the canonical resolution of the identity MP2 (RI-MP2) energy while still showing a very early crossover with respect to the computational effort. Based on extensive benchmark calculations, relative energies are reproduced with an error of typically <0.2 kcal/mol. The efficiency of the local MP2 (LMP2) method can be drastically improved by carrying out the LMP2 iterations in a basis of pair natural orbitals. While the present work focuses on local electron correlation, it is of much broader applicability to computation with sparse tensors in quantum chemistry and beyond.},

The main challenges for the implementation stem from the magnetic-field dependence in the Hamiltonian, or, more precisely, the appearance of the angular momentum operator, due to which the wave function becomes complex and which introduces a gauge-origin dependence. For this reason, an implementation of a complex CC code is required together with the use of gauge-including atomic orbitals to ensure gauge-origin independence. Results of coupled-cluster singles-doubles-perturbative-triples (CCSD(T)) calculations are presented for atoms and molecules with a focus on the dependence of correlation and binding energies on the magnetic field.},

abstract = {Multi-reference (MR) electronic structure methods, such as MR configuration interaction or MR perturbation theory, can provide reliable energies and properties for many molecular phenomena like bond breaking, excited states, transition states or magnetic properties of transition metal complexes and clusters. However, owing to their inherent complexity, most MR methods are still too computationally expensive for large systems. Therefore the development of more computationally attractive MR approaches is necessary to enable routine application for large-scale chemical systems. Among the state-of-the-art MR methods, second-order N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2) is an efficient, size-consistent, and intruder-state-free method. However, there are still two important bottlenecks in practical applications of NEVPT2 to large systems: (a) the high computational cost of NEVPT2 for large molecules, even with moderate active spaces and (b) the prohibitive cost for treating large active spaces. In this work, we address problem (a) by developing a linear scaling “partially contracted” NEVPT2 method. This development uses the idea of domain-based local pair natural orbitals (DLPNOs) to form a highly efficient algorithm. As shown previously in the framework of single-reference methods, the DLPNO concept leads to an enormous reduction in computational effort while at the same time providing high accuracy (approaching 99.9% of the correlation energy), robustness, and black-box character. In the DLPNO approach, the virtual space is spanned by pair natural orbitals that are expanded in terms of projected atomic orbitals in large orbital domains, while the inactive space is spanned by localized orbitals. The active orbitals are left untouched. Our implementation features a highly efficient “electron pair prescreening” that skips the negligible inactive pairs. The surviving pairs are treated using the partially contracted NEVPT2 formalism. A detailed comparison between the partial and strong contraction schemes is made, with conclusions that discourage the strong contraction scheme as a basis for local correlation methods due to its non-invariance with respect to rotations in the inactive and external subspaces. A minimal set of conservatively chosen truncation thresholds controls the accuracy of the method. With the default thresholds, about 99.9% of the canonical partially contracted NEVPT2 correlation energy is recovered while the crossover of the computational cost with the already very efficient canonical method occurs reasonably early; in linear chain type compounds at a chain length of around 80 atoms. Calculations are reported for systems with more than 300 atoms and 5400 basis functions.},

abstract = {The effective fragment potential (EFP) approach, which can be described as a nonempirical polarizable force field, affords an accurate first-principles treatment of noncovalent interactions in extended systems. EFP can also describe the effect of the environment on the electronic properties (e.g., electronic excitation energies and ionization and electron-attachment energies) of a subsystem via the QM/EFP (quantum mechanics/EFP) polarizable embedding scheme. The original formulation of the method assumes that the system can be separated, without breaking covalent bonds, into closed-shell fragments, such as solvent and solute molecules. Here, we present an extension of the EFP method to macromolecules (mEFP). Several schemes for breaking a large molecule into small fragments described by EFP are presented and benchmarked. We focus on the electronic properties of molecules embedded into a protein environment and consider ionization, electron-attachment, and excitation energies (single-point calculations only). The model systems include chromophores of green and red fluorescent proteins surrounded by several nearby amino acid residues and phenolate bound to the T4 lysozyme. All mEFP schemes show robust performance and accurately reproduce the reference full QM calculations. For further applications of mEFP, we recommend either the scheme in which the peptide is cut along the C $\alpha$ −C bond, giving rise to one fragment per amino acid, or the scheme with two cuts per amino acid, along the C $\alpha$ −C and C $\alpha$ −N bonds. While using these fragmentation schemes, the errors in solvatochromic shifts in electronic energy differences (excitation, ionization, electron detachment, or electron-attachment) do not exceed 0.1 eV. The largest error of QM/mEFP against QM/EFP (no fragmentation of the EFP part) is 0.06 eV (in most cases, the errors are 0.01−0.02 eV). The errors in the QM/molecular mechanics calculations with standard point charges can be as large as 0.3 eV.},

Focusing on locality measures that reflects the spatial extent of the bulk of an orbital and the thickness of orbital tails, we discuss, with numerical illustrations, how the locality may be reported for individual orbitals as well as for sets of orbitals. Traditional and more recent orbital localization functions are reviewed, and the locality measures are used to compare the locality of the orbitals generated by the different localization functions, both for occupied and virtual orbitals.

Then we move to larger systems, from dinucleotides to single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides. We focus on the possible role of charge transfer and delocalized or excitonic states in the photophysics of these systems and discuss the main photochemical paths.

With the extreme ranges of solvatochromism, the studied dyes possess 5-7 times weaker solvatofluorochromism, which can be rationalized via their decreased dipolarity in the fluorescent state. They also demonstrate an inverse dependence of their fluorescence quantum yield on solvent polarity and have near-record Stokes shifts in high-polarity media.

abstract = {As the length of molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories grows with increasing computational power, so does the importance of clustering methods for partitioning trajectories into conformational bins. Of the methods available, the vast majority require users to either have some a priori knowledge about the system to be clustered or to tune clustering parameters through trial and error. Here we present non-parametric uses of two modern clustering techniques suitable for first-pass investigation of an MD trajectory. Being non-parametric, these methods require neither prior knowledge nor parameter tuning. The first method, HDBSCAN, is fast-relative to other popular clustering methods-and is able to group unstructured or intrinsically disordered systems (such as intrinsically disordered proteins, or IDPs) into bins that represent global conformational shifts. HDBSCAN is also useful for determining the overall stability of a system-as it tends to group stable systems into one or two bins-and identifying transition events between metastable states. The second method, iMWK-Means, with explicit rescaling followed by K-Means, while slower than HDBSCAN, performs well with stable, structured systems such as folded proteins and is able to identify higher resolution details such as changes in relative position of secondary structural elements. Used in conjunction, these clustering methods allow a user to discern quickly and without prior knowledge the stability of a simulated system and identify both local and global conformational changes.},

abstract = {The X-ray constrained wavefunction (XC-WF) method proposed by Jayatilaka [Jayatilaka & Grimwood (2001), {\it Acta Cryst.} A{\bf 57}, 76{--}86] has attracted much attention because it represents a possible third way of theoretically studying the electronic structure of atoms and molecules, combining features of the more popular wavefunction- and DFT-based approaches. In its original formulation, the XC-WF technique extracts statistically plausible wavefunctions from experimental X-ray diffraction data of molecular crystals. A weight is used to constrain the pure Hartree{--}Fock solution to the observed X-ray structure factors. Despite the wavefunction being a single Slater determinant, it is generally assumed that its flexibility could guarantee the capture, better than any other experimental model, of electron correlation effects, absent in the Hartree{--}Fock Hamiltonian but present in the structure factors measured experimentally. However, although the approach has been known for long time, careful testing of this fundamental hypothesis is still missing. Since a formal demonstration is impossible, the validation can only be done heuristically and, to accomplish this task, X-ray constrained Hartree{--}Fock calculations have been performed using structure factor amplitudes computed at a very high correlation level (coupled cluster) for selected molecules in isolation, in order to avoid the perturbations due to intermolecular interactions. The results show that a single-determinant XC-WF is able to capture the electron correlation effects only partially. The largest amount of electron correlation is extracted when: (i) a large external weight is used (much larger than what has normally been used in XC-WF calculations using experimental data); and (ii) the high-order reflections, which carry less information on the electron correlation, are down-weighted (or even excluded), otherwise they would bias the fitting towards the unconstrained Hartree{--}Fock wavefunction.},

abstract = {The frozen-virtual natural-orbital (NO) approach, whereby the unoccupied-orbital space is constructed using a correlated density such as that from many-body perturbation theory, has proven to yield compact wave functions for determining ground-state correlation energies and associated properties, with corresponding occupation numbers providing a guide to the truncation of the virtual space. In this work this approach is tested for the first time for the calculation of higher-order response properties, particularly frequency-dependent dipole polarizabilities using coupled-cluster theory. We find that such properties are much more sensitive to the truncation of virtual space in the NO basis than in the original canonical molecular orbital (CMO) basis, with truncation errors increasing linearly with respect to the number of frozen virtual NOs. The reasons behind this poor performance include the more diffuse nature of NOs with low occupation numbers as well as the reduction in sparsity of the perturbed singles amplitudes in the NO basis and the neglect of orbital response. We tested a number of approaches to improve the performance of the NO space, including the use of a field-perturbed density to define the virtual orbitals and various external-space corrections. The truncation of the CMO space, on the other hand, yields errors in coupled-cluster dipole polarizabilities of less than 2% even after removing as much as 50% of the full virtual space. We find that this positive performance of the CMO space results from a cancellation of errors due to the truncation of the unperturbed and perturbed amplitudes, as well as sparsity of the singles amplitudes. We introduce a simple criterion called a dipole amplitude to use as a threshold for truncating the CMO basis for such property calculations.},

The 1.1 release represents a major update meant to automate complex tasks, such as geometry optimization using complete-basis-set extrapolation or focal-point methods. Conversion of the top-level code to a Python module means that Psi4 can now be used in complex workflows alongside other Python tools. Several new features have been added with the aid of libraries providing easy access to techniques such as density fitting, Cholesky decomposition, and Laplace denominators. The build system has been completely rewritten to simplify interoperability with independent, reusable software components for quantum chemistry. Finally, a wide range of new theoretical methods and analyses have been added to the code base, including functional-group and open-shell symmetry adapted perturbation theory, density-fitted coupled cluster with frozen natural orbitals, orbital-optimized perturbation and coupled-cluster methods (e.g., OO-MP2 and OO-LCCD), density-fitted multiconfigurational self-consistent field, density cumulant functional theory, algebraic-diagrammatic construction excited states, improvements to the geometry optimizer, and the "X2C" approach to relativistic corrections, among many other improvements.},

abstract = {Inclusion of charge penetration corrects the short-range error in the electrostatic model of the AMOEBA force field, and improves the accuracy of interactions ranging from nucleic acid base stacking to protein–ligand binding. The principal challenge of using classical physics to model biomolecular interactions is capturing the nature of short-range interactions that drive biological processes from nucleic acid base stacking to protein–ligand binding. In particular most classical force fields suffer from an error in their electrostatic models that arises from an ability to account for the overlap between charge distributions occurring when molecules get close to each other, known as charge penetration. In this work we present a simple, physically motivated model for including charge penetration in the AMOEBA (Atomic Multipole Optimized Energetics for Biomolecular Applications) force field. With a function derived from the charge distribution of a hydrogen-like atom and a limited number of parameters, our charge penetration model dramatically improves the description of electrostatics at short range. On a database of 101 biomolecular dimers, the charge penetration model brings the error in the electrostatic interaction energy relative to the ab initio SAPT electrostatic interaction energy from 13.4 kcal mol −1 to 1.3 kcal mol −1 . The model is shown not only to be robust and transferable for the AMOEBA model, but also physically meaningful as it universally improves the description of the electrostatic potential around a given molecule. },

We analyze the performance of the polarizable density embedding (PDE) model - a new multiscale computational approach designed for prediction and rationalization of general molecular properties of large and complex systems. We showcase how the PDE model very effectively handles the use of large and diffuse basis sets that are otherwise questionable - due to electron spill-out effects - in standard embedding models. Based on our analysis, we find the PDE model to be robust and much more systematic than less sophisticated focused embedding models, and thus outline the PDE model as a very efficient and accurate approach to describe the electronic structure of ground and excited states as well as molecular properties of complex, heterogeneous systems.},

We apply a recent analysis to both Kohn-Sham and orbital-free DFT, as well as to partition DFT, which generalizes all aspects of standard DFT. In each case, the analysis distinguishes between errors in approximate functionals versus errors in the self-consistent density. This yields insights into the origins of many errors in DFT calculations, especially those often attributed to self-interaction or delocalization error. In many classes of problems, errors can be substantially reduced by using better densities. We review the history of these approaches, discuss many of their applications, and give simple pedagogical examples.},

Understanding how channelrhodopsins work is important for applications in optogenetics, where light activation of these proteins triggers changes in the transmembrane potential across excitable membranes. A fundamental open question is how the protein environment ensures that unproductive proton transfer from the retinal Schiff base to the nearby carboxylate counterion is avoided in the resting state of the channel. To address this question, we performed combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical proton transfer calculations with explicit treatment of the surrounding lipid membrane. The free energy profiles computed for proton transfer to the counterion, either via a direct jump or mediated by a water molecule, demonstrate that, when retinal is all-trans, water and protein electrostatic interactions largely favour the protonated retinal Schiff base state. We identified a conserved lysine group as an essential structural element for the proton transfer energetics in channelrhodopsins.},

abstract = {Crystallography and quantum mechanics have always been tightly connected because reliable quantum mechanical models are needed to determine crystal structures. Due to this natural synergy, nowadays accurate distributions of electrons in space can be obtained from diffraction and scattering experiments. In the original definition of quantum crystallography (QCr) given by Massa, Karle and Huang, direct extraction of wavefunctions or density matrices from measured intensities of reflections or, conversely, ad hoc quantum mechanical calculations to enhance the accuracy of the crystallographic refinement are implicated. Nevertheless, many other active and emerging research areas involving quantum mechanics and scattering experiments are not covered by the original definition although they enable to observe and explain quantum phenomena as accurately and successfully as the original strategies. Therefore, we give an overview over current research that is related to a broader notion of QCr, and discuss options how QCr can evolve to become a complete and independent domain of natural sciences. The goal of this paper is to initiate discussions around QCr, but not to find a final definition of the field.},

abstract = {Charge-transfer (CT) is an important binding force in the formation of intermolecular complexes, and there have been a variety of theoretical models proposed to quantify this effect. These approaches, which typically rely on a definition of a “CT-free” state based on a partition of the system, sometimes yield significantly different results for a given intermolecular complex. Two widely used definitions of the “CT-free” state, the absolutely localized molecular orbitals (ALMO) method (where only on-fragment orbital mixings are permitted) and the constrained density functional theory (CDFT) approach (where fragment electron populations are fixed), are carefully examined in this work. Natural bond orbital (NBO) and the regularized symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) are also briefly considered. Results for the ALMO and CDFT definitions of CT are compared on a broad range of model systems, including hydrogen-bonding systems, borane complexes, metal–carbonyl complexes, and complexes formed by water and metal cations. For most of these systems, CDFT yields a much smaller equilibrium CT energy compared to that given by the ALMO-based definition. This is mainly because the CDFT population constraint does not fully inhibit CT, which means that the CDFT “CT-free” state is in fact CT-contaminated. Examples of this contamination include (i) matching forward and backward donation (e.g., formic acid dimer) and (ii) unidirectional CT without changing fragment populations. The magnitude of the latter effect is quantified in systems such as the water dimer by employing a 3-space density constraint in addition to the orbital constraint. Furthermore, by means of the adiabatic EDA, it is shown that several observable effects of CT, such as the “pyramidalization” of the planar BH3 molecule upon the complexation with Lewis bases, already appear on the “CT-free” CDFT surface. These results reveal the essential distinctions between the ALMO and CDFT definitions of CT and suggest that the former is more consistent with accepted understanding of the role of CT in intermolecular binding.},

Accuracy and large-scale applicability are demonstrated with three case studies, and we further analyze the importance of both state-specific and linear-response-type corrections to the excitation energies in the presence of the polarizable environment. We demonstrate how our combined method can be readily applied to study photo-induced biochemical processes as we model the charge-transfer (CT) excitation which is key to the photoprotection mechanism in the dodecin protein with PE-ADC(2). Through direct access to state-of-the-art excited state analysis, we find that the polarizable environment plays a decisive role by significantly increasing the CT character of the electronic excitation in dodecin. PE-ADC is thus suited to decipher photoinduced processes in complex, biomolecular systems at high precision and at reasonable computational cost.},

abstract = {We present a thorough investigation of the errors in results obtained with the combination of frozen-density embedding theory and the algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme for the polarization propagator of second order (FDE-ADC(2)). The study was carried out on a set of 52 intermolecular complexes with varying interaction strength, each consisting of a chromophore of fundamental interest and a few small molecules in its environment. The errors emerging in frozen-density embedding theory-based methods originate from (a) the solver of the quantum many-body problem used to obtain the embedded wave function ($\Psi$ A emb), (b) the approximation for the explicit density functional for the embedding potential, and (c) the choice of the density representing the environment ($\rho_B (r)$). The present work provides a comprehensive analysis of the errors in the excitation energies based on the last two factors. Furthermore, a density-overlap-based parameter is proposed to be used as an a priori criterion of applicability.},

In recent years, the combination of mass spectrometry and computational chemistry has been proven to be powerful and effective for the exploration of reaction mechanisms. The former provides information of possible reaction intermediates, which are difficult to obtain using other experimental methods, while the latter gives detailed structural information of reaction intermediates and explores reaction energy profiles. This review covers applications of the combined method and highlights its strengths in mechanistic studies. Representative works are discussed to demonstrate the complementarity and synergy of mass spectrometry and computational chemistry. Some challenges in mechanistic studies with these tools and their possible solutions, as well as the trend for future developments are also discussed.},

abstract = {Although many programs have been published for fully numerical Hartree-Fock (HF) or density functional (DF) calculations on atoms, we are not aware of any programs that support hybrid DFs, which are popular within the quantum chemistry community due to their better accuracy for many applications, or that can be used to calculate electric properties. Here, we present a variational atomic finite element solver in the HelFEM program suite that overcomes these limitations. A basis set of the type (Formula presented.) is used, where Bn(r) are finite element shape functions and (Formula presented.) are spherical harmonics, which allows for an arbitrary level of accuracy. HelFEM supports nonrelativistic HF and DF calculations even with hybrid functionals, which are not available in other commonly available program packages. Hundreds of functionals at the local spin-density approximation (LDA), generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), as well as the meta-GGA levels of theory are included through an interface with the Libxc library. Electric response properties are achievable via finite field calculations. We introduce an alternative grid that yields faster convergence to the complete basis set limit than commonly used alternatives. We also show that high-order Lagrange interpolating polynomials yield the best convergence, and that excellent agreement with literature HF limit values for electric properties, such as static dipole polarizabilities, can be achieved with the present approach. Dipole moments and dipole polarizabilities at finite field are also reported with the PBE, PBEh, TPSS, and TPSSh functionals. Finally, we show that a recently published Gaussian basis set is able to reproduce absolute HF and DF energies of neutral atoms, cations, as well as anions within a few dozen microhartrees.},

Besides these C[tbnd]C triple peaks, we found that the background in the region increased during the UV exposure due to the C[tbnd]C signals from polymers. In addition, the anisotropic compression during polymerization was also detected, which supports the proposed interpretation of X-ray data reported previously.

Monostable rhodopsins release retinal upon isomerization as opposed to the retinal in bistable rhodopsins that “reisomerize” upon absorption of a second photon. Understanding the mechanistic differences between these light-sensitive GPCRs has been hindered by the scarcity of recombinant models of the latter. Here, we reveal the high-resolution crystal structure of a recombinant bistable rhodopsin, jumping spider rhodopsin-1, bound to the inverse agonist 9-cis retinal. We observe a water-mediated network around the ligand hinting toward the basis of their bistable nature. In contrast to bovine rhodopsin (monostable), the transmembrane bundle of jumping spider rhodopsin-1 as well that of the bistable squid rhodopsin adopts a more “activation-ready” conformation often observed in other nonphotosensitive class A GPCRs. These similarities suggest the role of jumping spider rhodopsin-1 as a potential model system in the study of the structure–function relationship of both photosensitive and nonphotosensitive class A GPCRs.},

abstract = {Clustering Molecular Dynamics trajectories is a common analysis that allows grouping together similar conformations. Several algorithms have been designed and optimized to perform this routine task, and among them, Quality Threshold stands as a very attractive option. This algorithm guarantees that in retrieved clusters no pair of frames will have a similarity value greater than a specified threshold, and hence, a set of strongly correlated frames are obtained for each cluster. In this work, it is shown that various commonly used software implementations are flawed by confusing Quality Threshold with another simplistic well-known clustering algorithm published by Daura et al. (Daura, X.; van Gunsteren, W. F.; Jaun, B.; Mark, A. E.; Gademann, K.; Seebach, D. Peptide Folding: When Simulation Meets Experiment. Angew. Chemie Int. Ed. 1999, 38 (1/2), 236-240). Daura's algorithm does not impose any quality threshold for the frames contained in retrieved clusters, bringing unrelated structural configurations altogether. The advantages of using Quality Threshold whenever possible to explore Molecular Dynamic trajectories is exemplified. An in-house implementation of the original Quality Threshold algorithm has been developed in order to illustrate our comments, and its code is freely available for further use by the scientific community.},

abstract = {An accurate but efficient description of noncovalent interactions is a key to predictive modeling of biological and materials systems. The effective fragment potential (EFP) is an ab initio-based force field that provides a physically meaningful decomposition of noncovalent interactions of a molecular system into Coulomb, polarization, dispersion, and exchange-repulsion components. An EFP simulation protocol consists of two steps, preparing parameters for molecular fragments by a series of ab initio calculations on each individual fragment, and calculation of interaction energy and properties of a total molecular system based on the prepared parameters. As the fragment parameters (distributed multipoles, polarizabilities, localized wave function, etc.) depend on a fragment geometry, straightforward application of the EFP method requires recomputing parameters of each fragment if its geometry changes, for example, during thermal fluctuations of a molecular system. Thus, recomputing fragment parameters can easily become both computational and human bottlenecks and lead to a loss of efficiency of a simulation protocol. An alternative approach, in which fragment parameters are adjusted to different fragment geometries, referred to as "flexible EFP", is explored here. The parameter adjustment is based on translations and rotations of local coordinate frames associated with fragment atoms. The protocol is validated on extensive benchmark of amino acid dimers extracted from molecular dynamics snapshots of a cryptochrome protein. A parameter database for standard amino acids is developed to automate flexible EFP simulations in proteins. To demonstrate applicability of flexible EFP in large-scale protein simulations, binding energies and vertical electron ionization and electron attachment energies of a lumiflavin chromophore of the cryptochrome protein are computed. The results obtained with flexible EFP are in a close agreement with the standard EFP procedure but provide a significant reduction in computational cost.},

QM/MM excitation energies computed with time-dependent Hartree-Fock and the algebraic diagrammatic construction through second-order are benchmarked against supermolecular calculations to validate these new pseudopotentials. The QM/MM calculations with pseudopotentials give accurate results that are stable with augmentation of the basis set with diffuse functions.

abstract = {Channelrhodopsins are photosensitive proteins that trigger flagella motion in single-cell algae and have been successfully utilized in optogenetic applications. In optogenetics, light is used to activate neural cells in living organisms, which can be achieved by exploiting the ion channel signaling of channelrhodopsins. Tailoring channelrhodopsins for such applications includes the tuning of the absorption maximum. In order to establish rational design and to obtain a desired spectral shift, a basic understanding of the absorption spectrum is required. We have studied the chimera C1C2 as a representative of this protein family and the first member with an available crystal structure. For this purpose, we sampled the conformations of C1C2 using quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical molecular dynamics and subjected the resulting snapshots of the trajectory to excitation energy calculations using ADC(2) and simplified time-dependent density functional theory. In contrast to previous reports, we found that different hydrogen-bonding networks - involving the retinal protonated Schiff base, the putative counterions E162 and D292, and water molecules - had only a small impact on the absorption spectrum. However, in the case of deprotonated E162, increasing the distance to the Schiff base hydrogen-bonding partner led to a systematic blue shift. The $\beta$-ionone ring rotation was identified as another important contributor. Yet the most important factors were found to be the bond length alternation and bond order alternation that were linearly correlated to the absorption maximum by up to 62 and 82\%, respectively. We ascribe this novel insight into the structural basis of the absorption spectrum to our enhanced protein setup that includes membrane embedding as well as long and extensive sampling.},

The main aim was to gain insight into the specific interactions of each isomer and their impact on the absorption maximum in JSR1. The absorption spectra were computed using sampled snapshots from QM/MM molecular dynamics trajectories and compared to their experimental counterparts. The chromophore--protein interactions were analyzed by visualizing the electrostatic potential of the protein and projecting it onto the chromophore. It was found that the distance between a nearby tyrosine (Y126) residue plays a larger role in the predicted absorption maximum than the primary counterion (E194). Geometric differences between the isomers were also noted, including a structural change in the polyene chain of the chromophore, as well as changes in the nearby hydrogen bonding network.},

abstract = {This study utilizes the FMN-dependent NADH:quinone oxidoreductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to investigate the effect of introducing an active site negative charge on the flavin absorption spectrum both in the absence and presence of a long-range electrostatic potential coming from solution ions. There were no observed changes in the flavin UV-visible spectrum when an active site tyrosine (Y277) becomes deprotonated in vitro. These results could only be reproduced computationally using average solvent electrostatic configuration (ASEC) QM/MM simulations that include both positive and negative solution ions. The same calculations performed with minimal ions to neutralize the total protein charge predicted that deprotonating Y277 would significantly alter the flavin absorption spectrum. Analyzing the distribution of solution ions indicated that the ions reorganize around the protein surface upon Y277 deprotonation to cancel the effect of the tyrosinate on the flavin absorption spectrum. Additional biochemical experiments were performed to test this hypothesis.},

abstract = {We present a novel technique for computing the free energy differences between two chromophore ``isomers'' hosted in a molecular environment (a generalized solvent). Such an environment may range from a relatively rigid protein cavity to a flexible solvent environment. The technique is characterized by the application of the previously reported "average electrostatic solvent configuration"method, and it is based on the idea of using the free energy perturbation theory along with a chromophore annihilation procedure in thermodynamic cycle calculations. The method is benchmarked by computing the ground-state room-temperature relative stabilities between (i) the cis and trans isomers of prototypal animal and microbial rhodopsins and (ii) the analogue isomers of a rhodopsin-like light-driven molecular switch in methanol. Furthermore, we show that the same technology can be used to estimate the activation free energy for the thermal isomerization of systems i-ii by replacing one isomer with a transition state. The results show that the computed relative stability and isomerization barrier magnitudes for the selected systems are in line with the available experimental observation in spite of their widely diverse complexity.},

abstract = {Abstract Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations are a popular approach to study various features of large systems. A common application of QM/MM calculations is in the investigation of reaction mechanisms in condensed-phase and biological systems. The combination of QM and MM methods to represent a system gives rise to several challenges that need to be addressed. The increase in computational speed has allowed the expanded use of more complicated and accurate methods for both QM and MM simulations. Here, we review some approaches that address several common challenges encountered in QM/MM simulations with advanced polarizable potentials, from methods to account for boundary across covalent bonds and long-range effects, to polarization and advanced embedding potentials.

abstract = {The extension of the frozen-density embedding theory for nonvariational methods [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2020, 16, 6880] was utilized to evaluate intermolecular interaction energies for complexes in the Zhao-Truhlar basis set. In the applied method (FDET-MP2-FAT-LDA), the same auxiliary system is used to evaluate the correlation energy by means of the second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), as in our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 2019, 150, 121101]. Local density approximation is used for ExcTnad[$\rho$A,$\rho$B] in both cases. Additionally, the contribution to the energy due to the neglected correlation potential was evaluated and analyzed. The domain of applicability of the local density approximation for ExcTnad[$\rho$A,$\rho$B] was determined based on deviations from the interaction energies from the conventional MP2 calculations. The local density approximation for ExcTnad[$\rho$A,$\rho$B] performs well for hydrogen- or dipole-bound complexes. The relative errors in the interaction energy lie within 3-30%. While for charge-transfer complexes, this approximation fails consistently, and for other types of complexes, the performance of this approximation is not systematic. The sources of error are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {The viability and effectiveness of replacing an ensemble of embedded solute calculations by a single calculation using an average description of the solvent environment are evaluated. This work explores the fluctuations of the average description of the system obtained in two ways: from calculations on an ensemble of geometries and from an average environment constructed from the same ensemble. To this end, classical molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid acetone solute in SPCE water are performed in order to generate an ensemble of solvent environments. From this ensemble of solvent configurations, a number of different approaches for constructing an average solvent environment are employed. We perform a thorough numerical analysis of the fluctuations of the electrostatic potential experienced by the solute, as well as the resulting fluctuations of the solute's electronic density, measured through its dipole moment and fitted atomic point charges. At the same time, we inspect the accuracy of the methods used to construct average environments. Finally, the proposed method for generating the embedding potential from an average environment density is applied to estimate the solvatochromic shift of the first excitation of acetone. In order to account for quantum confinement effects, which may be important in certain cases, the fluctuations in the shift due to the interaction with the solvent are evaluated using frozen-density-embedding theory. Our results demonstrate that, for normally distributed environments, the constructed average environment is a reasonably good representation of a fluctuating molecular solvent environment. We then provide guidance for future comparisons between these theoretical treatments of solute/solvent systems to experimental measurements.},

abstract = {A new non-decomposable approximation of the non-additive kinetic energy potential is constructed starting from the same exact property in the limit ($\rho$A → 0 and$\rho$B = 2), as introduced in the work of Lastra et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 129, 074107 (2008)]. In order to cover the complete function space for exponentially decaying densities, the kernel of a differential operator D$\gamma$[$\rho$] is introduced and analyzed in dependence of $\gamma$. The conclusive choice of $\gamma$ = 1 assures that the solution functions span the complete space of molecular electron densities. As a result, the new approximant preserves the desired feature of the older approximation, which is the reciprocal singularity if the electron density decays exponentially, and eliminates artificial shallow wells (holes), which are responsible for an artificial "charge leak."Numerical considerations using the standard validation procedure introduced by Wesolowski and Weber [Chem. Phys. Lett. 248, 71-76 (1996)] demonstrate the numerical performance of the developed approximation, which increases the range of applicability of semilocal functionals.},
